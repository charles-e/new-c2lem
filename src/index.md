# Welcome to c2lem<span>.</span>com

## Who?

My domain name explained:

- **"c"** = Charles
- **"2"** = to
- **"lem"** = "le magne" (French) = "the great" (English)

So, Charlemagne — just Charles really — and, no, I am neither French nor Norman nor Great.  
This is the internet; I could be a dog for all you know.

Be that as it may, you are visiting my small internet domain/empire; my *pied-à-terre*, if you will.

## What?

Whatever I am interested in that's worth posting — for now this includes:

- [Books](/books/): For newer books, these posts are (no spoilers) reviews. Otherwise, these are just observations for my own memory.
- [Now Reading](/books/in-progress/): Pretty self-explanatory — books currently in progress.
- [Blog](/weeklies/): Weekly posts: a bunch of links that I find topical, distracting, or otherwise interesting. (YMMV.)

## How?
- This site is hosted on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) because its free tier is **free**!
- The site is built using the blog generator, [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), because both [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/chatgpt) and [Gemini](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/) suggested it.

- Human readable content with *opinion* is, ya know, created by me, myself and I.
