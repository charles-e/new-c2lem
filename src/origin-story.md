# Origin Story
I have been maintaining a blog on [WordPress.com](https://wordpress.com), but I found that as a beginner, it really wants me to "pick a lane" for my content (either book stuff or news stuff — no easy way to have them both without too much effort). 
And on top of that, you __pay for the service__, which is just a low-grade stressor I don't need living in DJT's america.

So I have been puttering around with a thing called [Web Origami](https://weborigami.org) hoping to eventually produce something I could host for cheaper than WordPress.

- Then one day a few months ago, I found [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) , and its free tier lets me host the blog.
- Last week, sick of hacking on web origami, elegantly-designed as it is, I decided to let an AI — specifically [Gemini](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/) — help me design my blog to reuse the markdown posts that were already in WordPress. "What's the worst that could happen?", I thought.
- The AI suggested I use a blog generator called [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/). Like a newbie, I asked it to generate the whole blog with book notes and weekly posts... After a few hours, I got stuck where it couldn't seem to make everything work.
- So I started over with the intention of taking baby steps. To make a clean start, I used [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/chatgpt) , which also suggested Eleventy. I asked it to just create a book blog.  
  Once I got that working, I moved on to books in progress, then to RSS feeds, and so on.  
  It has taken about a day — working with the AI, and a whole lot of copying/pasting and bug-hunting — to create something that doesn't embarrass me.

PS, this is **not** an endorsement of ChatGPT over Gemini because **I don't know enough** to say one is better than the other. I only switched AIs because of an __emotional__ impulse, I believe that __working in smaller steps__ is the leading factor in my second try success.
