My domain name explained:

- **"c"** = Charles
- **"2"** = to
- **"lem"** = "le magne" (French) = "the great" (English)

So, Charlemagne — just Charles really — and, no, I am neither French nor Norman nor Great.  
This is the internet; I could be a dog for all you know.

Be that as it may, you are visiting my small internet domain/empire; my *pied-à-terre*, if you will.
