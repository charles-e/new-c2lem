This novella (100 pages) follows Veronica Brinkley the wife of a wealthy husband. Said husband is admitting her to an asylum presumably to cure her of chronic depression.
The year is 1923 and by the way the asylum/hospital is on the moon.  And the doctor and his assistant really do not seemed concerned with treating her.  They are drugging
her and performing operations on her.  She begins having dreams and memories that although they seems to be hers are at the same time not hers; for
example she dreams of her childhood in a cabin and then "remembers" killing her family with an ax.  And then the doctor has another assistant, the
last member of the Moon Spider cult, who helps with the operations. Yeah, the hospital is built on top of the caves where the, now dead, Moon Spider and her cult
lived.  Eventually we see spiders crawling out of the healing wounds from Veronica's operation.  Anyway the book is a surreal nightmare that flies off the handle in a beautiful creepfest.  I loved it.
