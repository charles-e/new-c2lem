(This is a book I am backfilling because goodreads reminded me of it - memory imperfect but I will try.)
Imagine that religions/mythologies are like crime families and they compete over followers (more worshippers == more power, catholicism, islam and hindu are the big fish in the religion game).  Shigidi is in an african (old, weak) pantheon as a low level demon of nightmares: he can scare people to death.  He is a "working stiff" who hates his job taking orders from his lazy, incompetent superiors.  He meets and falls in love with Nneoma a succubus (from a different pantheon of course) and they make a good team, not quite Bonnie and Clyde, but together they work to beat and cheat the spiritual rat race. They get involved with a heist of the titular Brass Head of Obufalon.  Along the way Aleister Crowley has a cameo appearance. Very fun fast paced story.
