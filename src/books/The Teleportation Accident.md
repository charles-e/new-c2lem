I am on a Ned Beauman jag because I enjoyed Lumpfish so much that I had to try out his other publications.   

This one has as its protagonist a young man, Egon Loeser whose biggest problem is that simply can not "get laid." in spite of having a generous allowance from his wealthy parents.  Early on in the story he believes that he had a "near miss" with an attractive young lady, Adele Hitler, and he spends the entirety of the novel trying to get her back, in the process emigrating first to Paris and then to Los Angeles. I should mention that the novel begins in 1931 Berlin and Egon is a set designer whose idol,role-model is Lavancini and whose ultimate goal is to recreate a 'Teleportation Device' used to "instantaneously" transport actors between different parts of the stage. disasterously 
In spite of Egon's migration out of Germany to France and then Los Angeles that is absolutely cosynchronous with WWII and Germany's extermination of Jews, Egon steadfastly ignores the war, and in spite of having many jewish friends, just insists to any inquiries, that he knows nothing about "politics".

No, in fact she has rather a cud duck, as we used to say at school.

Every few months his father had sent coded letters to Tiny Lustre to update its leaders on the progress of their clinamen, but of course he couldn't ever reveal their current location in case the letters were intercepted and the code was broken, so he had received no news in return.
