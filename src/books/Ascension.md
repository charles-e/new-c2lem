Your basic, man goes on a journey and comes back crazy novel.  Told, of course, in epistolary form. Harold, our returned man, is a physicist polymath, thought dead for over 10 years is discovered in a hospital by his brother along with a packet of unsent letters.  The letters tell the story of a doomed, and ultimately covered-up, expedition on a mysterious mountain where neither time nor geometry can be taken for granted.  In parallel, Harold's tragic life prior to the expedition is revealed and religion is discussed.  I finished this 350ish page book in about two days so I would say it is a bit of a page turner.
