	Krotov had told him the state was not interested in whether people believed its lies. The state was not looking for plausible deniability. A good lie could always be punctured, with enough work. No, Krotov had said-all they needed was implausible deniability. A lie the population would see through immediately but would have to pretend they believed. Even to themselves.

Our setting is maybe 50 years in the future. Super-intelligent AI is ubiquitous, as is near-impermeable state surveillance (which is supercharged by AI).  The story's plot spans from democratic London to an anonymous, benevolent-AI-governed eastern european state to the (not benevolent at all) Russian Federation.

The Federation is a totalitarian dictatorship with an immortal leader thanks to neural connectome transplants. Naturally, the federation government system is AI-assisted which enables a brutal system of social/political credits and punishment. Russia being Russia, there is (as always) a shadowy, ruthless, resistance movement.  As the book begins, the leader of the Federation is in failing health (caused by "upgrades" in the previous transplant/rebirth) and this situation is the catalyst for the story.

A wide-ranging, complicated and compartmentalized scheme hatched by Russia's resistance aims to replace the Federation's leader with someone more benevolent.  The story tracks various characters, who, whether they know it or not, *whether they survive or not*, are participants in, obstacles to, or collateral victims of the scheme. Here are a few of the more memorable characters: 
- Zoya, an elderly, highly influential, exiled Russian dissident, is contacted by the resistance who have an idea of how she can help them replace the government.
- Lilia, a genius programmer, trapped in the Federation but rescued by the resistance so she can give them some software that can compromise an AI.
- Nurlan, a legislative assistant in Eastern Europe. He lives through the collapse of his country's AI-controlled government.
- Nikolai, a doctor who is helping transfer the president's brain-state to a replacement body.

While the plot slithers to its resolution the action is embroidered with a multitude of intriguing ideas, such as:
* Social status scoring systems of control
* the AI as *deus ex machina* (belief in AI infallibility)
* the AI subverting/escaping built-in guard rails
* the AI as human romantic partner
* The ecology of the Russian Taiga
* Russian folk-lore, (the Baba Yaga, bears, magical huts)
* Split-brain syndrome and its implications
* Massive immortal cloned colonies of plants.

This book is disturbingly plausibly terrifying, yet also so fascinating that I finished this densely structured novel in two days.
