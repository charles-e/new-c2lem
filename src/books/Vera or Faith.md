A story about Vera a very smart, precocious, somewhat autistic fifth grader whose family life is complicated.  She is half Korean on her (birth) mother's side from which genetic fountain she receives beautiful cheek bones. 'Anne Mom' is her de facto (on Vera's word list) mother because her 'Mom mom' left when she was still just an infant. Her father is a Russian-emigre entrepreneur/editor/publisher who has been fired from several magazines and is trying to start another one.  

Her story is set in a near future upper-east-side NYC, in an America heading closer and closer to authoritarian government, to wit the shameless propagandizing by the government for a 5/3 amendment to the constitution (think of it as the opposite of the 3/5 amendment) that seems to be a fait accompli.  And of course 'Anne Mom', every bit a white do-good liberal, is fundraising from her friends to oppose the amendment.  Additionally this future has anti-abortion states enforcing laws allowing them to bloodtest women at their borders to prevent illegal out-of-state abortions.

Anne attends a very exclusive school.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Hawaii forcibly quarantined individuals with Hansen's disease, also known as leprosy, at a settlement on the Kalaupapa peninsula of Moloka'i. This policy, enacted due to the perceived contagiousness of the disease, led to the isolation of over 8,000 people, primarily Native Hawaiians, who were sent there against their will. Kalaupapa, a remote location with natural barriers, became a place of forced exile and suffering for those affected by leprosy. )
 Vera hated the location of her bedroom, hated being apart from the rest of the family, as if she were one of the Hawaiian lepers they covered in last year’s oppression module.
