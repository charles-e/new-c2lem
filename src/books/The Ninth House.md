On the cover Stephen King says, "Impossible to put down", and godamit he is correct; it took me just over 48 hours to consume this.  The premise is absurd of course, but the protagonist is extremely sympathetic; the plot twists come with a perfect stochastic non-rhythm; and the magical stunts are creatively fun.   
I know that I don't have perfect vulnerability to Ms. Bardugo's craft, because I found "Six of Crows" entirely to be in the realm of books that can be put down, but this book, this book completely bypassed my jaded, picky inner critic.
