<blockquote>“We are all going to heaven and Vandyck is of the company – in other words, how good life seemed, how sweet its rewards, how trivial this grudge or that grievance, how admirable friendship and the society of one’s kind, as, lighting a good cigarette, one sank among the cushions in the window-seat.”

The author's 1929 essay where she was asked (we are told) to comment on women and fiction.  And her opinion, stated in the first couple of pages, is that in order to write (any book) a woman needs her own room and 500 pounds a year.  (I asked OpenAI what that equates to in 2025 dollars and got an answer of $56,000 however that seems low given that she assumes it seems a fairly high standard of living.  I would say $200,000 is a better guess -- end digression)  She hand waves, which is to say refuses to give opinions on the questions of what kind and what quality of books women might write and the qualities of females in general.  She also warns that when she provides names, dates and places it will be strictly fictional; the rest of the 172 pages contain the author's rambling, peripatetic, indeed brook-like, flow of thoughts as she justifies her conclusions.  

I am very happy with using a metaphorical brook to describe her prose; I have fond memories of summer backpacking trips that followed creeks, brooks or streams and the sensation of falling asleep to the sound of rushing water.  Likewise, I found the journey of this essay with few exceptions to be very pleasant as long as I was paying attention (context switching in the prose can be subtle). This is my first book from Woolf and I hope that though it be non-fiction this introduction to her writing style will prepare me to tackle fiction from the "Most important progenitor stream of conciousness".

Other take-aways:

* I honestly have a hard time with distinguishing female compared to male prose apart from obvious cues of subject matter (e.g. gratuitous violence, misogeny) and Woolf describes various authors having gender-neutral prose (Shakespeare for example).  But then again I am a guy so I swim in the patriarchy....

* She spends a great deal of verbiage making clear the various, quite stringent, legal and societal obstacles to publishing anything written by a woman up to about 1800 and the gradual relaxation of those restrictions until women received the vote in the decade prior to the essay.  And yet, even up until the 1960s in the USA women could not get a mortgage in order to purchase a house.  And now we have "tradwives" who are attempting to reverse the pendulum of freedom for females.

* And, of course, I have not read many of Woolf's (especially anglocentric) literary touchstones.

             There has fallen a splendid tear                 From the passion-flower at the gate.             She is coming, my dove, my dear;                 She is coming, my life, my fate;             The red rose cries, ‘She is near, she is near’;                 And the white rose weeps, ‘She is late’;             The larkspur listens, ‘I hear, I hear’;                 And the lily whispers, ‘I wait.”

* <span meta="26.7@2025-08-26T15:00:08.468Z"></span> “I had been drawing a face, a figure. It was the face and the figure of Professor von X engaged in writing his monumental work entitled The Mental, Moral, and Physical Inferiority of the Female Sex. He was not in my picture a man attractive to women. He was heavily built; he had a great jowl; to balance that he had very small eyes; he was very red in the face. His expression suggested that he was labouring under some emotion that made him jab his pen on the paper as if he were killing some noxious insect as he wrote, but even when he had killed it that did not satisfy him; he must go on killing it; and even so, some cause for anger and irritation remained. Could it be his wife, I asked, looking at my picture? Was she in love with a cavalry officer?”

* <span meta="34.8@2025-08-26T23:05:26.438Z"></span> (end of part 2) “Remove that protection, expose them to the same exertions and activities, make them soldiers and sailors and engine-drivers and dock labourers, and will not women die off so much younger, so much quicker, than men that one will say, ‘I saw a woman today’, as one used to say, ‘I saw an aeroplane’. Anything may happen when womanhood has ceased to be a protected occupation, I thought, opening the door. But what bearing has all this upon the subject of my paper, Women and Fiction? I asked, going indoors.”

* <span meta="42.2@2025-08-29T02:02:49.326Z"></span> “It was the relic of the sense of chastity that dictated anonymity to women even so late in the nineteenth century. Currer Bell, George Eliot, George Sand, all the victims of inner strife as their writings prove, sought ineffectively to veil themselves by using the name of a man.”

* <span meta="62.7@2025-09-01T02:55:47.328Z"></span> “ One must have been something of a firebrand to say to oneself, Oh, but they can’t buy literature too. Literature is open to everybody. I refuse to allow you, Beadle though you are, to turn me off the grass. Lock up your libraries if you like; but there is no gate, no lock, no bolt that you can set upon the freedom of my mind.
But whatever effect discouragement and criticism ”

* <span meta="79.5@2025-09-01T23:13:08.964Z"></span> “And there is the girl behind the counter too – I would as soon have her true history as the hundred and fiftieth life of Napoleon or seventieth study of Keats and his use of Miltonic inversion which old Professor Z and his like are now inditing. And then I went on very warily, on the very tips of my toes (so cowardly am I, so afraid of the lash that was once almost laid on my own shoulders), to murmur that she should also learn to laugh, without bitterness, at the vanities – say rather at the peculiarities, for it is a less offensive word – of the other sex.”

* <span meta="77@2025-09-02T00:00:03.690Z"></span> “But she did her best. Considering that Mary Carmichael was no genius, but an unknown girl writing her first novel in a bed-sitting-room, without enough of those desirable things, time, money, and idleness, she did not do so badly, I thought.”

* <span meta="84.3@2025-09-04T14:14:23.465Z"></span> “No opinion has been expressed, you may say, upon the comparative merits of the sexes even as writers. That was done purposely, because, even if the time had come for such a valuation – and it is far more important at the moment to know how much money women had and how many rooms than to theorize about their capacities – even if the time had come I do not believe that gifts, whether of mind or character, can be weighed like sugar and butter, not even in Cambridge, where they are so adept at putting people into classes and fixing caps on their heads and letters after their names.”
