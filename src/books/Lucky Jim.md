<blockquote>
“DIXON was alive again. Consciousness was upon him before he could get out of the way; not for him the slow, gracious wandering from the halls of sleep, but a summary, forcible ejection. He lay sprawled, too wicked to move, spewed up like a broken spider-crab on the tarry shingle of the morning. The light did him harm, but not as much as looking at things did; he resolved, having done it once, never to move his eyeballs again. ”

This is an amusing read about class-based prejudice, academia, and the sex lives of college students in post-WWII England.  At about 20% through the book, the description of protagonist Jim Dixon's hangover is resoundingly worth the price of admission.  (But you must have had a bad hangover at least once in order to appreciate it, so guess there is a "height requirement" as well.)

The biggest problem with the book is that it is very dated such that I can imagine an entire generation of Playboy readers had this in their lifetime "must/best read" lists. (and even that joke that I have attempted is dated.) It is also a little challenging because of English slang from the 1950s.

Jim Dixon, lecturer in history (stalky & wide; chubby) and his music-obsessed boss Professor Edward (Ned) (neddy) Welch (tall and weedy, lank white hair) 

* <span meta="2.7@2025-10-13T03:09:08.806Z"></span> “Welch had been flicking water from his hands, a movement he now arrested. He looked like an African savage being shown a simple conjuring trick. He said: 'Coffee-time?”

* <span meta="5.9@2025-10-13T03:09:45.064Z"></span> “He half-listened for a minute or so while Margaret described how good Mrs Welch had been to her in fetching her from the hospital and installing her at the Welches' home to convalesce. She had undoubtedly been very kind to Margaret, even though at other times, when publicly disagreeing with her husband for example, she was the only living being capable of making Dixon sympathize with him.”

* <span meta="12.1@2025-10-13T19:58:43.632Z"></span> “There was no reason to suppose that the week-end would contain anything better than the familiar mixture of predicted boredom with unpredicted boredom, but for the moment he was unable to believe this. The acceptance of his article might be the prelude to a run of badly-needed luck. He was going to meet some people who might well prove interesting and amusing. ”

* <span meta="17.5@2025-10-13T20:43:26.494Z"></span> (I don't understand this.) “Oh, in a fortnight or so, I expect,' Bertrand said, then added significantly: 'Miss Callaghan and I have another engagement for next week-end. You'll understand I don't want to miss that.''The week-end after's the Summer Ball at the College.' Margaret cut in quickly, in an attempt, Dixon supposed, to smother the overtones of this last declaration. How could Bertrand possibly bring himself to say things like that in front of one woman he hardly knew and one man he must guess hadn't liked him all that much at a first meeting?”
