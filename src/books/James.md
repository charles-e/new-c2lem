In Huckleberry Finn, especially in the last few chapters, poor old Jim puts up with so much bullshit, especially galling is that Jim has been emancipated and has this fact withheld from him in order for Tom Sawyer and Huck to play pretend heroes.   And of course the Twain version of slavery wasn't even attempting to hold a candle to the existential horror of real world slavery.

<span class="spoiler">
In this book Jim (James) can mock the whites who assume he is dumb. And then 
the plot spins out of control to the point where James is taking bloody revenge on the whites who are holding his wife. And finally we see James escaping to Canada.

This book could not exist without Huckleberry Finn and you should read Huck Finn before you read this.
