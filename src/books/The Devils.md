A team of "Devils" who do dirty work for the Pope (and are otherwise kept under lock and key): the Pope's A-Team but set in an alternate 12th(? guessing) century where Rome lost to Carthage, women dominate the church hierarchy and, certainly there is a great deal of magic of various varieties.  I was first on the library waiting list for this book, having read many of the "First Law" stories: all of which is to say that I had high hopes.  It is, of course, a well written book with very strong, distinct characters. It started off a little slow but then picked up at the first big battle, unfortunately there were four big battles in the book and I found my self slogging through them because once the characters where developed (around the time of the first battle) they were not surprising me any longer and the battle themselves did not have an interesting connection to the plot.  The dialog is just too sitcom for me: it felt like it needed a laugh track.  The main through-line of the book is that every seemingly good, noble person who interacts with the Devils is in reality a sneaky snake villain and if they do not fall in to that category then they are just obviously villains.

This book has a lot going for it, vivid characters, there are some actual character development arcs and the story is built on a fun, interesting world but for whatever reason I was not sucked in, perhaps this is the case where I am a jaded reader who just needs something new(er) to tickle his fancy.  I did "finish" the book but I was super-skimming through the last fourth of the book.
