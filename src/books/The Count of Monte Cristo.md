Last week I saw a tiktok where a young woman breathlessly described this book as "swashbuckling" (or was it "adventurous"?) and all I could think was that she watched the Guy Ritchie movie and assumed that it had *some bearing* on what happened in the book.  And actually having read the book cover to cover (mostly) I can say that the best thing about reading the book is having the right to say to that tiktok influencer, "I have read the book and you have no idea what the fuck you are talking about!".  And also it gives me the ability to watch three or four different movie-adaptations and commiserate with the poor screen writers choices about what to cut/streamline in the shambling mound of spaghetti that is the plot of this novel.

Having said that, and feeling much better I gotta give Dumas credit because he wrote that thing to be released a chapter at a time every week or two and there aren't any gigantic plot holes (that I know of. please don't flame me.).  On the other hand I have to say that the book is slow, verbose as well as hard to follow at points, which, now living in the time of rampant AI, isn't a problem because you can just ask, "what did I just read?", and get instant gratification.  Overall the prose in this book is just ok though a few passages, at certain critical junctures are striking. (and anyway this is a translation from french so whats the point of ragging on prose?)

I am not a historian of fiction so I can't tell you if this is the first revenge thriller *ever*, but the best movie analogue I thought of is Mission Impossible, because a big feature of the plot is that Dantes disguises himself in order to use the Abbée Busoni and Lord Wilmore as his alter egos.  

This book has lots of what I assume is "wealth/power porn" where Dumas name-drops the painter of the paintings on the walls, the manufacturer of vases on the tables, the lineage of a horse, where the fish came from, etc, the same way current writers tell you exactly what model of Porsche the hero is driving.  And the Count never goes anywhere at normal speed, and instead arranges horse relays, has a yacht waiting for him, etc so that his travel takes hours when normally it might be days (for not rich people).  I think contemporaneous male readers of his story appreciated this, while the 19th century brand-placement goes over a modern readers head.

And going back to my earlier point about this not being a "swashbuckling" novel, it isn't swashbuckling "on screen" by the Count, but, his servants act, in, at times, swashbuckling and/or gallant ways on his behalf, for example when Ali stops the runaway horse for Mrs Villefort.  And then there are his bandit friends in Italy and Haydée his beautiful greek slave girl.  He has a lot of really nice swashbuckling acquaintances and props, but the Count never actually breaks out a rapier (though he does practice with a very expensive flintlock).

His actual revenge methods are relatively indirect, with Danglar's downfall the most directly caused by the Count. In particular you see the Count commit wire (telegraph) fraud (in one of the most amusing chapters) in order to harm Danglar's investments. And then, when Danglars flees his bank failure in France, the Count's italian bandit friends capture and extort from him to enact vengeance, Danglars remains alive though poor at the end of the book.

On the other hand, the count's most important and guilty victim Villeforte's demise is also non fatal: he goes insane, but his insanity is the result of his wife being a serial murderer (poisoner) and the revelation that he has a bastard son, Benedetto who is a criminal on trial for murder.  Now, Dantes did *find* Benedetto, set him up with a false noble identity (Cavalcanti) and give him a very handsome, though temporary, salary with the intent of getting him married to Danglar's daughter Eugenie.  But the Count did not engineer Benedetto's murder and resultant appearance before before Villeforte, nor did he arrange Madame Villeforte to be a serial killer.  This is all *deux ex machina* Dumas, but hey, I'm sure it made the readers happy. 

Yes, I am skipping over Dantes crisis over the morality of his revenge and probably ten other important points, but I am done.  Anyway, in keeping with my tradition, here is a nice pull quote:
<blockquote>
Morrel advanced with a firm, manly tread, and poor Barrois followed him, as he best might. Morrel was only thirty-one, Barrois was sixty years of age; Morrel was deeply in love, and Barrois was dying of heat and exertion. These two men, thus opposed in age and interests, resembled two parts of a triangle, presenting the extremes of separation, yet possessing their point of union. This point of union was Noirtier, and it was he who had just sent for Morrel with the request that he would Waste no time in coming to him, - a command which Morrel obeyed to the letter, to the great discomfiture of Barrois.

At the same time, her arms, naked to the elbow, arms that were tanned but otherwise seemed modelled on those of the Venus of Arles, trembled with a sort of feverish impatience, and she was tapping the ground with her supple, well-made foot, revealing a leg that was shapely, bold and proud, but imprisoned in a red cotton stocking patterned in grey and blue lozenges”
 
A young and beautiful girl, with hair as black as jet, her eyes as velvety as the gazelles, was leaning with her back against the wainscot, rubbing in her slender fingers, moulded after the antique style, a bunch of heath-blossoms, the flowers of which she was picking off and strewing on the floor; her arms bare to the elbow, tanned, and resembling those of the Venus at Arles, moved with a kind of restless impatience, and she tapped the earth with her pliant and well-formed foot so as to display the pure and full shape of her well-turned leg, in its red cotton stocking with grey and blue clocks.
* <span meta="4.9@2025-08-30T22:14:32.943Z"></span> “Come on, come on,’ Danglars muttered. ‘I think that the matter is properly under way now, and all we have to do is to let it take its course.”

* <span meta="6.4@2025-09-01T20:09:18.711Z"></span> “Why, then, they shall be breached,’ said M. de Salvieux. ‘Was he himself so scrupulous, when it came to shooting the poor Duc d’Enghien?’8”

* <span meta="6.8@2025-09-01T20:31:15.467Z"></span> Villefort swears he will be pityless to his mom(?) but hints to his fiance that he will be merciful.

* <span meta="6.9@2025-09-02T22:20:15.756Z"></span> “In reality, apart from the memory of his father’s choice of political allegiance (which, if he did not himself completely renounce it, might affect his own career), Gérard de Villefort was at that moment as happy as it is possible for a man to be. At the age of twenty-six, already wealthy in his own right, he held a high office in the legal profession; and he was to marry a beautiful young woman whom he loved, not with passion, but reasonably, as a deputy crown prosecutor may love.”

* <span meta="6.1@2025-09-02T23:00:58.844Z"></span> This is ominous tho: 
'Alas! alas!' murmured he, 'if the procureur du roi had been here in Marseilles, I should have been ruined. This accursed letter would have destroyed all my hopes. Oh! father, must your past career always interfere with mine?
Suddenly a light passed over his face, a smile played round his mouth, and his lips relaxed."This will do”, said he, “and from this letter, which might have ruined me, I will make my fortune.”

* <span meta="7.1@2025-09-08T02:48:45.446Z"></span> Danglars alone was happy and contented, he had got rid of an enemy and preserved his situation on board the Pharaon; Danglars was one of those men born with a pen behind the ear, and an inkstand in place of a heart. Everything with him was multiplication or subtraction, and he estimated the life of a man as less precious than a figure, when that figure could increase and that life diminish the total of the amount.

But his patience and his expectations were alike vain. Yet there he stood, day after day, exposed to the rays of a burning sun, with no other protection for his head than a red handkerchief twisted around it in the manner of the Spanish muleteers. This anxious, careworn innkeeper was no other than our old acquaintance, Caderousse

* <span meta="22@2025-10-11T23:42:53.618Z"></span> Dumas makes Caderousse omniscient and its kinda lame

* <span meta="24.9@2025-10-20T20:13:20.466Z"></span> Morrel is saved! I don't get why we had to have Dantes show up twice to make this happen?  (then again, I haven't spent a great deal of brain power contemplating this.) Anyway Eddie says he is done playing secret santa.

'you heard our repast announced; will you now take the trouble to enter the salle-à-manger, your humble servant going first to show the way?
(The banquet hosted by Amphitryon is famously marked by a mythological twist in which Zeus, disguised as Amphitryon, gives a grand feast in Amphitryon’s likeness while the real Amphitryon is away. When Amphitryon returns home, a dispute arises over who is truly the host—the man physically present or the god who provided the feast. The guests and servants resolve this by deciding that the true host is he who gave the feast, highlighting the importance of hospitality and generosity in ancient culture. This banquet story emphasizes themes of identity, deception, and honor, with the act of hosting being a symbol of social status and control over the household.​)

I know all that, for it is with the justice of all countries that I have occupied myself - it is with the criminal procedure of all nations that I have compared natural justice, and I must say, sir, that it is the law of primitive nations; that is, the law of retaliation that I have most frequently found to be according to the law of God.
