Long and kinda pointless but I have enjoyed many other Murakami books so I held on, listening in the car, through all 38ish hours. I probably did not understand some of the symbolism which may be why it did not impact me as maybe could have been intended. That and (our female protagonist) Aomame’s backstory is left surprisingly sketchy: at the beginning of the story she is a part-time vigilante assassin of abusive men and I wish her path to that was explained. Also she has a mystical destined relationship with a man she hasn’t seen in 20 years and who she only “knew” as a 6th grader, but not enough to speak with.
Anyway there are some interesting elements to this fantasy but they are all left hanging in the clouds with no strong foundation that I could cling to. o well, its an audiobook that I completed to fill in my Murakami collection.
