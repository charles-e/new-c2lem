Meh.  I have read several of his books, the best being, "The Girl With All the Gifts" (and the prequel to this).  Maybe I know all his gimmicks now so that I am immune.  I would call this Zootopia meets Warhammer sorta; its the continuation of a duology about the apocalyptic struggle between two multiversal empires.  
But it never felt like like the stakes were truly serious or I never committed to this book.  Mr. Carey *can* write though:

<blockquote>
The children with their bulging bellies full of nothing but air, their xylophone ribs and exophthalmic stares. The listless men and women, exhausted by the endless wait for death.
</blockquote>

And it was purple rather than green because it used the retinaldehyde molecule where the plants of most other worlds used chlorophyll.”

You must be aware of the theory that any noetic analogue, any thinking mechanism so long as it is sufficiently complex can be made to replicate any other. It follows that the code that defines and constructs each of us three is compatible with that of the other two. All that is required is to devise a suitable interface program.”

It was easy to put his suit on autopilot with instructions to keep heading north in the convoy and alert him if anything changed. Even easier to dose himself up with a bespoke cocktail of nutrients, sedatives and neuro-actives and slip into a dreamless doze. The mission on Tsakom had been a ball-breaker: it was good to grab a little rest. His body was in ceaseless motion but his mind floated free of it.”
