Homicide Detective Ethan Krol's new case begins...

<blockquote>
“With a mumbled “Good morning” to the uniform at the door, he stepped past the tape and into a neat, nicely accessorized apartment, pulling on a pair of latex gloves as he did so. The bright blue of Lake Michigan was clearly visible through the floor-to-ceiling windows. He drank the view in for a moment, steadying himself. Only then did he look down.

There were three bodies on the floor. Only two of which were human.

“What the hell is that?” he asked.

“It’s a barracuda. Leastways, if you believe Carter over there.”
</blockquote>
This starts as a "locked room" mystery.  A father and his infant are murdered, having been drowned in ocean water.  Only problem is the scene of the crime is 30th floor apartment in Chicago, so where'd the ocean water come from (the ocean is at least 600 miles away) also oddly the wife is left unconscious but otherwise untouched.  The murderer has very cleverly avoided leaving any clues (all the cameras magically malfunction in his presence) to this seemingly impossible murder.  

A few days later in Bristol UK, Abidemi Eniola from "Nigeria" is trying to get her bearings in unfamiliar surroundings.  She speaks English with anachronistic slang she almost immediately bumps into Holly Rogers, who helps Abi fence some diamonds that she needs for spending money.  We don't exactly who or what Abi is but it quickly becomes clear that she with her oddly phrased English and Holly have a chemistry, a magnetism that attracts the reader.  Abi also has access to technology which makes her possibly very dangerous.  
Ethan is called by police in Rhode Island as there has been another ocean drowning murder.  It soon becomes clear that the murderer has a connection to Nigeria and that the victims are all related in some mysterious way.  Eventually the police release a composite sketch of the murderer and they are contacted by a historian who believes he has met the killer who was researching a merchant ship from 1830 named the Esperance.  
There is somehow a connection to Nigeria that Ethan comes to understand because the killer uses Nigerian references (his fake company is named "Super Eagle" after the Nigerian men's soccer team).

The killer and Abi are both equipped with technological gadgets far beyond the police who are chasing them.  The story builds as the police close in on the killer....  And things don't go as planned. I don't want to ruin it for you, but it's worth reading.  I enjoyed the characters and the gadgets.

<span class="spoiler">
I just read a very flawed first novel for a friend of mine and so I want to consider this the way I read her book to see why this one worked for me the way her's did not.  
In the end it turns out that Abi and Yemi travel using inter-dimensional gates from their distant home world.  Yemi is punishing the descendants of the owners of the Esperance, a slaving vessel whose crew having run out of water while lost at sea, begins dumping their cargo of slaves in order to slow their usage of water. It turns out the extraterrestrial visitors watching this horrific episode decided to save the remaining slaves from drowning/sharks.  Yemi and Abi are both descendants of those slaves.  Yemi (Abi's father) believes that biblical style punishment (over generations of descendant's) is appropriate for this (truly heinous crime).  This is somewhat plausible because the rescued and resettled slaves have very long lifespans thanks to very advanced technology, thus the horror of the 300 year old drownings is still fresh.  Abi has been sent to stop Yemi.  It is also revealed that the drowning punishments are another use of the same inter-dimensional gate technology this time to move huge volumes of ocean water.  And at this point I thought, "Hmmm, I am not buying it.  If this was made clear earlier in the book I probably would have stopped reading. (I mean, if your civilization has inter-dimensional gates then you have better things to do than arranging performative executions on a backwards planet. )" Yet, Mr. Oyebanji did know this was the premise behind the plot and still chose to write the book.  I have to say that in spite of the shade I am casting on the premise of the book, he managed through well-paced action, well-developed, likeable characters, and well-used gadget-plot-devices to keep all the balls in the air until about the last 20 pages. And I obviously enjoyed it enough to finish it in a day and then spew this much verbiage commenting on it.
