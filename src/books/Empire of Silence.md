This is the first book in a series that I have been meaning to read for a while.  It is a space opera that follows Hadrian Marlowe, the son
of a wealthy family on  a planet called Terra.  The story is told in the first person and Hadrian is writing his memoirs.
The book begins with Hadrian dissatisfied with his family's plans for him; he wants to become an explorer
while his father intends for him to take over the governorship (dukedom).  He does a lot of whining and then (accidentally on purpose) sabotages his fathers plans.
He is also a scholar who
speaks several languages and an artist.
