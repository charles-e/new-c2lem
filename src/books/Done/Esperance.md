Homicide Detective Ethan Krol's new case begins...

<blockquote>
“With a mumbled “Good morning” to the uniform at the door, he stepped past the tape and into a neat, nicely accessorized apartment, pulling on a pair of latex gloves as he did so. The bright blue of Lake Michigan was clearly visible through the floor-to-ceiling windows. He drank the view in for a moment, steadying himself. Only then did he look down.

There were three bodies on the floor. Only two of which were human.

“What the hell is that?” he asked.

“It’s a barracuda. Leastways, if you believe Carter over there.”
</blockquote>
This starts as "locked room" mystery.  A father and his baby are murdered, having been drowned in ocean water.  Only problem is the scene of the crime is 30th floor apartment in Chicago.  Our homicide detective is very competent and very likable but the murderer is very cleverly avoided leaving any clues to this seemingly impossible murder.  Meanwhile in Bristol UK, Abidemi Eniola from "Nigeria" is trying to get her bearings in unfamiliar surroundings.  She speaks English with anachronistic slang she almost immediately bumps into Holly Rogers, who helps Abi fence some diamonds that she needs for spending money.  We don't exactly who or what Abi is but it quickly becomes clear that she with her oddly phrased English and Holly have a chemistry, a magnetism that attracts the reader.  Abi also has access to technology which makes her possibly very dangerous.  
Ethan is called by police in Rhode Island as there has been another murder by ocean drowning.  It soon becomes clear that the murderer has a connection to Nigeria and that the victims are all related in some mysterious way.  Eventually the police release a composite sketch of the murderer and they are contacted by a historian who believes he has met the killer who was researching merchant ship from 1830: the Esperance.  
There is somehow a connection to Nigeria that the Ethan comes to understand because the killer uses Nigerian references (his fake company "Super Eagle" )

I just read a very flawed first novel for a friend of mine and so I want to consider this the way I read her book to see why this one worked for me the way her's did not.
