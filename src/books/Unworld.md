Imagine we live, say, 15 years in the future and (the well-to-do) you can now buy a device sort of like an Apple Watch, but its a full blown AI, an AI with real long term memory and opinions of its own.  And it is with you on your wrist capable of knowing not just your heart rate, blood pressure, but also hormones in your bloodstream.  And its always listening and if you enable it, it can access all the cameras in your home or car on devices.  It turns out when you own one of these things a useful, fun thing to do is to frequently "sync" with it to compare your memories of the day with the AI's memories of the day.  How handy would that be? Like if you were on a diet you would have a vigilante buddy keeping you from cheating! Imagine how intimate your relationship would be with this always near, always on device? Now imagine that AIs are legally "people" and that means that your personal AI device can actual come in to conflict with you to the point where it might want to be "emancipated/divorced" and that is legal.
This device, called an "upload", is the most salient feature of the possible near future described in this story. Note, probably my biggest quibble with this story is that I wish the author came up with something snappier to call the device -- I like "MyGeist" or just "geist", but hey, if that's my biggest problem ... long story short, yeah: I really thought this book was the bee's knees!)

The actual story in this world is about a couple, Anna and Rick, the plot begins six months after their 13 year old son, Alex who with no obvious warning signs apparently committed suicide. The couple is visiting the house of their best friends, Jen and Amir, who have a daughter, 17-yo Samantha, best friends with Alex and who was with Alex on the night he died, and for added drama the families have not seen each other since the death of Alex.  

Note that all of the adults in this scenario are upper middle class professionals who have each adopted the "geist" device into their lifestyles.  Most importantly, Anna has had the device for eight years and it turns out that Anna has allowed her geist to independently perform a significant number of parenting tasks alone with Alex.  Thus with Alex's sudden departure, some suspicion falls on the geist, and we learn eventually, in fact, Alex called the otherwise unnamed device "Aviva".  
In summary the book is about the already horrific grieving process and the added emotional (guilt) complication caused by the geist's quasi parental relationship with Alex.  Boiled down like that it doesn't sound like much but the writing (by a Guy!) is very strong and manages to describe a very melodramatic situation with the emotional nuance of all the characters (especially Alex) in granular, clear detail.  
Many thumbs up!

* <span meta="3@2025-08-17T15:43:24.245Z"></span> Chapter 1: Anna - she is divorcing Rick - she has a flashback to her son Alex and a VR game "Unworld".

* <span meta="25@2025-08-18T04:12:09.035Z"></span> (so I was wrong about divorcing Rick, shes trying to prevent her implant from divorcing her!) “I—I have something to tell you,” I began. She waited. “I went to see a lawyer. This morning.” Still nothing. “To see what my options were,” I added. Then, when she still remained silent, added: “To prevent you from leaving.” If she could have cocked an eyebrow, she would have. “And?”

* <span meta="31@2025-08-18T04:23:56.105Z"></span> (Carolyn now we know about emancipated uploads) Every time I swallowed the drops, I felt like a woman from some nineteenth-century salon, holding séances and communing with the imagined dead. My life, up until now, resembled a series of torched bridges, with all the people left behind on each island coughing and spluttering, never to see me again. I’d been settled on this particular island for a decade, which, I see now, is right about when the old demons start reawakening. 

* <span meta="35@2025-08-18T05:06:00.801Z"></span> (I assume this is the upload from the anna chapter) “Hello,” she said. The voice tickled my ear and made me jump, and for just a moment, everyone’s medieval fears about uploads made visceral sense to me. I resisted the impulse to swat at my ear, distracting myself instead by moving my big toes up and down in my shoes. My feet felt a continent away. My hand stayed at my side. “Who are you?” “My name is…,” she said, then stopped. “Call me Aviva.” “How did you find me, Aviva?” I tried to keep my voice curious, conversational.

* <span meta="39@2025-08-18T05:09:45.991Z"></span> She interrupted me, protesting for more details, but I waved her away. As it turned out, there was just no way to be interesting and an addict. Although Lord knows the idiosyncratic recovery group I joined tried its hardest to be. Self-styled anarchists and overcompensating autodidacts of every unimaginable stripe, united only by our hatred and loathing of conventional group dynamics and our commitment to only one steadfast rule: no more using.

* <span meta="48@2025-08-18T14:12:01.163Z"></span> (about Aviva's memories of Alex's death) At that moment, I understood several things about upload consciousness in rapid succession. Her intelligence wasn’t able to filter out or compartmentalize grief. She had no neurochemical responses flooding in to numb her pain, to soften its impact. A mind was eternal, unforgiving; a brain was a soft, plump cushion. Loss needed a brain. My pedantic mind stopped to scribble this insight somewhere, in case I might use it in a future class.

* <span meta="69@2025-08-19T16:13:27.448Z"></span> “Monkeys can’t plan.” Actually, it was chimpanzees; I had a hard time telling my primates apart. You could teach a chimp to drive a car, the teacher said—how my teacher knew this to be true, I have no idea, but he insisted on the point. You could demonstrate to the chimp the accelerator meant go, and the brake meant stop. You could even teach it to steer the car left and right, to avoid obstacles. But you could never explain to the chimpanzee how to drive up to a red light and stop at the intersection. The peculiarity of the distinction appealed to me. The minute they saw that red light, no matter how far away they were, they just stopped, cold. It didn’t matter if they were right under the signal or a quarter mile away.
