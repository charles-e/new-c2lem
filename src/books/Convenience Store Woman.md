A novella set in Japan about a weirdo, an, I assume, autistic, also asexual, woman, Keiko, who in early childhood realizes a set of rules to live by where she can exist peacefully in a society that has expectations about how people live. Shortly after matriculating to college she discovers that her new job at a convenience store allows her an identity, a social-figleaf as well as the satisfaction that comes from performing a job with skill, even if that job is not particularly important, lucrative or well respected.  
 
Keiko as a little girl after discovering a dead bird at the park....
<blockquote>
“What’s up, Keiko? Oh! A little bird … where did it come from I wonder?” she said gently, stroking my hair. “The poor thing. Shall we make a grave for it?”

“Let’s eat it!” I said.

“What?”

“Daddy likes yakitori, doesn’t he? Let’s grill it and have it for dinner!”
</blockquote>

The story begins twenty years after taking her job at a convenience store when she is still at the store, the oldest worker who is only a year younger than the current store manager.  As middle age approaches, Keiko's normal obfuscations and excuses have worn thin so that her friends, relatives and co-workers wonder why she has not settled down, gotten married, had a career or children.  She must also confront the real existential problem of aging in a physical, subsistence-level job, where any injury may end her economic viability.

This book is only 150ish pages and it concerns the way that Keiko accepts her challenges as a oddball with cheerful honesty and resiliency. I smiled a lot along the way.

But subsequently everyone started hooking up with society, either through employment or marriage, and I was the only one who hadn’t done either.
While I always say it’s because I’m frail, deep down everyone must be thinking that if that’s so, why would I choose to do a job in which I’m on my feet for long periods every day?”

He looked as though he were made of wire, and his glasses were like silver twined around his face. He was wearing a white shirt and black trousers as dictated by the store rules, but he was too skinny and the shirt didn’t fit him, so that while his wrists were exposed, the fabric was unnaturally puckered around his stomach.
I covered my shock at his skin-and-bone appearance by quickly lowering my head in greeting.
“Pleased to meet you! I’m Furukura, from the day shift. Looking forward to working with you!” -->
