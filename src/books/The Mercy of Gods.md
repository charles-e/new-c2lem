Hmmm, the next project from the golden boys who wrote the Expanse, of which, though I enjoyed it, I only consumed it on Netflix.  Things that work in one medium don't always work in other media, but let's give it a shot.  Right out the gate I will say that the prose is serviceable but not even a little bit spectacular, nevertheless, here's a pull quote:
<blockquote>
“Tonner wanted a book. Or music. An entertainment feed showing bad comedies. He wanted a piece of art to look at and a glass of wine to sip. He wanted a café with a live band and a little bamboo dance floor. He wanted food so spicy it burned the next day when he took a shit. He wanted to meet a stranger in a library and to spend an hour flirting with them. He wanted a life. He wanted a possibility.”
</blockquote>

The book begins with characters in some sort of research facility on a planet named Anjinn. This is never explained: an advanced human civilization not unlike our own but not on Earth!!! Does mankind have an empire in beyond the Solar System?  Did they abandon Earth??? Oh well, this is supposed to be a space opera so just go with it. 

The book started out slow with some sort of academic competition, intrigue and I had to reread to get a fix on many of the characters (scientists, assistants and other support staff). But then Bam!; the much more advanced aliens show up, kill one person in eight (to show they are serious) and it turned out that there are really only four or five important characters.  Never mind then. Then things are sad and tedious but finally, if memory serves, maybe 150 pages in, we get to the real meat of the plot: the researchers are imprisoned by the aliens and are figuring out how to survive in captivity with no idea whether the rest of Anjiin's population even still exists.

This is the first book of, what I imagine will be, a several volume space opera of conflicting space empires, of which, at least this introductory volume, this **amuse bouche**, if you will, did amuse as well as intrigue me enough that I am waiting for volume two.

They are the foundation on which everything that comes after must be built. These dead people shape who the swarm is and who it is becoming.”

Jessyn looked at it all—everything they still had to do, everything that was arrayed against them—and it was like she was gearing herself up to swim across an ocean. Which was the same as preparing to drown.”

“Fuck,” Jessyn said, wiping at the sudden, embarrassing tears. “Fuck you both.”
“We love you too,” Campar said. Tentatively, he put his arm around her shoulder. When she leaned her head against his side, he relaxed into her too.”
