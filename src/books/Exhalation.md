Posting this because I needed something to link to.  But also because when I read it prior to this blog, maybe sometime in 2016, I was so excited, happy, astounded by how powerfully good it was.  Seriously, I typed out one of the stories in order to print it to give to my then girlfriend who did not read books.  Nowadays though, I can't really remember any of those stories and I need to go back and reread.
