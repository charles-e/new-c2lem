I started reading this just as a distraction from the longer reads that I was feeling bored with.  This book was perfectly acceptable as a distraction for the couple of weeks I needed to finish it without experiencing tedium.  The pull quotes on the cover advertise brilliance, belovedness and hilarity, while I found some mild amusement and serviceability as a review of the greek myths.  I think that 350 pages split into 28 bite-sized chapters with only a tiny bit of fussy vocabulary is the right size for a casual reader.  As a long time fantasy reader, with a college education only a couple of the stories were new to me but its a nice survey that doesn't gloss over the naughty and/or gruesome behaviors of god, demi-gods, monsters and humans.

* <span meta="8.5@2025-07-29T22:17:06.219Z"></span> “Kronos met these curses with a sneer and, corralling his mutilated father and newly freed mutant brothers at the point of his sickle, he led them down to Tartarus. The Hecatonchires and Cyclopes he imprisoned in the caves, but his father he buried even deeper, as far from his natural domain of the heavens as he could contrive”

* <span meta="15.2@2025-07-31T03:43:04.582Z"></span> “The shattered world was still smoking from the savagery of war. Zeus saw that it needed to heal and he knew that his own generation, the Third Order of divine beings, must manage better than the first two had done. It was time for a new order, an order purged of the wasteful bloodlust and elemental brutality that had marked earlier times.”
(in the last chapter we learned about the various nymphs, fates, muses, etc)

* <span meta="26.5@2025-08-02T00:55:35.162Z"></span> “Wave, Zeus. And for heaven’s sake, smile!’ Hera’s hissed undertone jerks him away.”

* <span meta="34.4@2025-08-03T21:17:57.074Z"></span> “And so death became a constant in human life, as it remains to this day. But the world of the Silver Age, it should be understood, was very different from our own. Gods, demigods and all kinds of immortals still walked amongst us. Intercourse of the personal, social and sexual kind with the gods was as normal to men and women of the Silver Age as intercourse with machines and AI assistants is to us today. And, I dare say, a great deal more fun.”

* <span meta="48.7@2025-08-08T00:53:52.347Z"></span> “Here Phaeton lies who in the sun-god’s chariot fared.
And though greatly he failed, more greatly he dared."

* <span meta="53.1@2025-08-08T20:33:48.822Z"></span> The birth of Dionysius - “The infant was suckled by the rain nymphs of Nysus;fn7 and, once weaned, was tutored by pot-bellied Silenus, who was to become his closest companion and follower – a kind of Falstaff to the young god’s Prince Hal. Silenus had his own train of followers too, the sileni – satyr-like creatures for ever associated with antic riot, rout and revelry.”

* <span meta="57.5@2025-08-09T00:12:24.241Z"></span> solecism - mistake: “Like Ixion before him he made the mistake of abusing Zeus’s hospitality, in his case by returning from a banquet on Olympus with stolen ambrosia and nectar in his pockets. He also committed the unpardonable solecism of telling tales about the private lives and mannerisms of the gods, amusing his courtiers and friends with insolent mimicry and gossip.”

* <span meta="63.7@2025-08-09T01:13:47.838Z"></span> catafalque - a framework to hold a coffin - “My dear,’ he said, drawing her to him, ‘I feel that soon I shall die. When I have breathed my last and my soul has fled what will you do?’
‘I will do what must be done, my lord. I will wash and anoint you. I will place an obolus on your tongue so that you might pay the ferryman. We will stand guard seven days and seven nights over your catafalque.”

* <span meta="63.1@2025-08-09T02:58:01.490Z"></span> corybantic: wild, hysterical “The next day Marsyas set off with his many followers to Lake Aulocrene. They had arranged to meet other satyrs there for a great feast at which Marsyas would play wild, corybantic dances of his own composition. ”

* <span meta="64.1@2025-08-09T04:11:05.974Z"></span> “In English we still talk of the ‘distaff side’ of a family, meaning the female line. The distaff was the spindle around which the wool or flax was wound preparatory to spinning. And those who spun were called ‘spinsters’, a name which once applied without negative connotation to any unmarried woman.”

* <span meta="68.4@2025-08-09T04:49:05.221Z"></span> 'nous' means common understanding of how things work -- “Round and round dashed the Cadmean Vixen, while hot on her tail flew Lailaps, from whom no prey could escape. They would still be caught in that logic loop now I suppose, if Zeus hadn’t done something about it.
The King of the Gods looked down at the sight and pondered the strange self-contradicting problem that presented such an affront to all proper reason and sense, and so vexingly subverted the notions embodied in that splendid Greek word nous. ”
“Zeus solved the conundrum by turning the fox and the dog to stone. In this way they stayed frozen in time, their perfect possibilities unachieved for eternity, their destinies for ever unreconciled. At length, even this locked state seemed to him to challenge common sense, so he catasterized them – removed them to the heavens – where they became the constellations of the Greater and Lesser Dogs, Canis Major and Canis Minor.”

* <span meta="79.5@2025-08-09T23:10:37.633Z"></span> (after the story of Echo and Narcissus) “Perhaps narcissism is best defined as a need to look on other people as mirrored surfaces who satisfy us only when they reflect back a loving or admiring image of ourselves. When we look into another’s eyes, in other words, we are not looking to see who they are, but how we are reflected in their eyes. By this definition, which of us can honestly disown our share of narcissism?”
