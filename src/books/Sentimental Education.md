I chose this book for a sidequest book club when it was my turn.  I chose it because someone on Tiktok said it was as if Anna Karenina was written with a male protagonist. I remember enjoying Anna K so that was a good omen.  Plus it is a "classic" -- what could go wrong?  Well, a lot because I quickly tired of the book and yet it was the book which *I* chose, therefore I felt that it was my obligation to read the thing I conned other people into reading. 

For one thing this book seems to be roughly half about our protagonist's (Fred's) love life and half about politics and culture.  Its the politics part that which dragged me down because its *French* politics... from 1865. With my half-assed American education I know that there was a big bad revolution in (checks wikipedia) 1789 and then there was Napoleon and then something something something.  And the first half of the book is dominated by Freddy swooning about a (married) girl and otherwise doing nothing much but talk politics and culture with his buddies (and his love-object's cheating husband). And since I have no insight into what Fred (or any other french person) might think about current events all the conversation went past me like the teacher's dialog in a Peanut's cartoon. 

Eventually, in the third part of the book things pick up; the climax of the book is during a revolution (yet another) in 1865. And Fred has a child with his (call-girl) mistress and then shortly thereafter the child dies.  The married love of his life leaves Paris to disappear because her crappy husband (Arnoux) is fleeing debts. His buddy marries the rich, pretty, naive girl (from Fred's hometown) who Freddy lead on and then dumped.  And yet another (also rich) married woman (Dambreuse) whose husband dies is suddenly not so rich and not so attractive and so Fred also ditches her.  

At the end of the book (10 years later?) Fred is no longer wealthy and is very much alone.  Fred reminds me of myself during my third decade: I was never happy with my love life and I disappointed many people not least of whom: myself.  

This novel was not for me and it was a bad choice on my part because I lack the necessary context to appreciate it (nor am I willing to acquire that context at this point in my life). But hey(!) after five months of reading, now I can say that I once read a French realist novel.  So I have that going for me.  Which is nice.

* <span meta="57@2025-07-25T03:57:11.611Z"></span> “Her children had gone out; there was nothing but stillness around her. It seemed as if she were utterly deserted.“He is going to be married! Is it possible?”And she was seized with a fit of nervous trembling.“Why is this? Does it mean that I love him?”Then all of a sudden:“Why, yes; I love him—I love him!”It seemed to her as if she were sinking into endless depths. The clock struck three. She listened to the vibrations of the sounds as they died away. And she remained on the edge of the armchair, with her eyes fixed and an unchanging smile on her face.”

[First time we get Ms Arnoux POV?]

* <span meta="57@2025-07-25T19:16:23.251Z"></span> “For the first time in his life Frédéric felt himself beloved; and this new pleasure, which did not transcend the ordinary run of agreeable sensations, made him swell with so much emotion that he spread out his two arms and flung back his head.A large cloud passed across the sky.“It is going towards Paris,” said Louise. “You’d like to follow it—wouldn’t you?”“I! Why?”“Who knows?”And surveying him with a sharp look:“Perhaps you have there” (she searched her mind for the appropriate phrase) “something to engage your affections.”“Oh! I have nothing to engage my affections there.”“Are you perfectly certain?”“Why, yes, Mademoiselle, perfectly certain!”

* <span meta="61@2025-07-27T03:50:19.171Z"></span> “For, indeed, you are not happy any more than I am! Oh! I know you. You have no one who responds to your craving for affection, for devotion. I will do anything you wish! I will not offend you! I swear to you that I will not!”And he let himself fall on his knees, in spite of himself, giving way beneath the weight of the feelings that oppressed his heart.“Get up!” she said; “get up, I insist!”And she declared in an imperious tone that if he did not comply with her wish, she would never see him again.”

She was waiting there for something the nature of which was not quite clear, but which, nevertheless, was of great importance; and, without knowing why, she was afraid of being seen. But an accursed little dog kept barking at her furiously and biting at the hem of her dress. He kept stubbornly coming back again and again, always barking more violently than before. Madame Arnoux woke up. The dog’s barking continued. She strained her ears to listen. It came from her son’s room. She rushed there in her bare feet. It was the child himself who was coughing. His hands were burning, his face flushed, and his voice strangely hoarse. Every minute he found it more difficult to breathe freely. She waited there till daybreak, bent over the coverlet watching him.”

The Republic is being double-crossed!” He was dissatisfied with everything, and especially with the fact that we had not taken back our natural frontiers.”
I think this is supposed to be funny.

Two days later, they began again at random, just as their coachman thought fit to drive them, without asking where they were, and often even neglecting the famous sites.”
(Places in Fountainbleu -- sounds nice)

I may have been!” wishing to convey in this way that he had been often fortunate in his love-affairs, so that she might have a better opinion of him, just as Rosanette did not avow how many lovers she had had, in order that he might have more respect for her—for there will always be found in the midst of the most intimate confidences restrictions, false shame, delicacy, and pity. You divine either in the other or in yourself precipices or muddy paths which prevent you from penetrating any farther; moreover, you feel that you will not be understood. It is hard to express accurately the thing you mean, whatever it may be; and this is the reason why perfect unions are rare.”
(Finally, something is happening.)

The Seine glided peacefully along. The sky was of a clear blue; and in the trees round the Tuileries birds were singing.”
(fred back in paris to find dussardier.)

* <span meta="75.9@2025-07-30T01:25:19.321Z"></span> “Then came the painter, the earthenware dealer, and Mademoiselle Louise; and, thanks to Martinon, who had taken his place to be near Cécile, Frédéric found himself beside Madame Arnoux.”
(fred is such a dick)

* <span meta="80.9@2025-07-31T19:47:12.209Z"></span> “Madame Dambreuse closed her eyes, and he was astonished at his easy victory. The tall trees in the garden stopped their gentle quivering. Motionless clouds streaked the sky with long strips of red, and on every side everything seemed to come to a standstill. Then he remembered, in a blurry sort of way, evenings just the same as this, filled with the same unbroken silence. Where was it that he had known them?”
(now he has seduced M. Dambreuse)

* <span meta="82.1@2025-07-31T20:09:01.116Z"></span> “Nevertheless, he approved of it; then, as Deslauriers was in touch with M. Roque, his friend explained to him how he stood with regard to Louise.“Tell them anything you like; that my affairs are in an unsettled state, that I am putting them in order. She is young enough to wait!”
( why does F just drag this out?)

* <span meta="82.7@2025-07-31T20:22:06.717Z"></span> “ People who left their names with the concierge made enquiries about her admiringly, and the passers-by were filled with respect on seeing the quantity of straw which was placed in the street under the windows.”
(what is the significance of this in caring for a patient?)

* <span meta="83.1@2025-07-31T20:28:45.660Z"></span> “The face was as yellow as straw. At the corners of the mouth there were traces of blood-stained foam. He had a silk handkerchief tied around his”
(M Dambreuse dead - how? - now wifey wants to remarry)

* <span meta="85.5@2025-08-01T20:38:15.302Z"></span> “ Since Frédéric’s defeat at the election, she was ambitious of obtaining for both of them a diplomatic post in Germany; therefore, the first thing they should do was to follow the current trends of ideas.”
( now f is juggling 2 women and his bastard son)

* <span meta="86.7@2025-08-03T00:50:02.309Z"></span> “In the Rue de Paradis, the concierge said that M. Arnoux had been away since the evening before. As for Madame, he ventured to say nothing; and Frédéric, having rushed like an arrow up the stairs, put his ear to the keyhole. Finally, the door was opened. Madame had gone out with Monsieur. The servant could not say when they would be back; her wages had been paid, and she was leaving herself.”
(fred borrows 12000F from Dambreuse for Arnoux!)
