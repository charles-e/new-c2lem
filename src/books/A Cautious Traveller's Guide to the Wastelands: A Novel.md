<blockquote>
There is a woman on the platform with a borrowed name. With steam in her eyes and the taste of oil on her lips. The shrill, desperate whistle of the train turns into the sobbing of a young girl nearby and the cries of the trinket vendors, hawking their flimsy amulets as protection against Wastelands sickness. She forces herself to look up, to stare at it face on, the train that looms above her, hissing and humming; waiting, vibrating with pent-up power. How huge it is, how implacably solid, three times the width of a horse-drawn carriage. It makes the station buildings look as flimsy as a child’s toys.

The book is laden down with lush descriptions and the story exists in a nicely crafted alternate Victorian earth where an armoured super train runs from Beijing to Moscow through an ever dangerous, ever changing Siberia. I would love to see this book get the full [**Moebius**](https://www.muddycolors.com/2012/03/i-%E2%99%A5-moebius/) treatment. As I was 2/3s of the way through this book, it occurred that I could compare this book to **Where the Wild Things Are**

It is said that so much had been taken from the land that it was always hungry. It had been feeding off the blood spilled by the empires, and by the bones of the animals and people they left behind. It gained a taste for death.
