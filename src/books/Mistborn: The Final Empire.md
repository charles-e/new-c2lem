I give Sanderson credit for developing a fantasy world and a system of magic that, apparently, many people enjoy.
But, this story, though it did have two main characters who did seem to be changing in relationship to a struggle, said struggle was dull
and did not move quickly enough for this reader and I finally gave it up after fourteen hours.
Additionally his prose is no better than mine, which is to say that it is, while articulate and clear, uninspired with neither interesting
vocabulary nor any analogies, metaphors, metonyms, poetics that lingered in mind and are therefore worth speaking of.
