“Or it’s a single, long night,” he said, looking the other way from the flickering candle, which I perceived was possibly still causing him slight injury.”

I would be in the Sandhills already by then, in my lodge with my wives in their ermine and elk teeth, my children sleeping in a pile of robes, the smoke from the fire curling up and up, past the blackened ear-flaps and into the sky, silver lines of light always scratching across it.
Or so I thought.
This is my telling for today.
The pipe is empty.”

I walked over, fell to my knees, and pushed that eye shut, held it shut with both hands, and I looked all around, for who could have done a thing like this, which was when a greased-shooter hit me in the shoulder right here, from so far off I didn’t even hear its sound. It spun me ten paces into another blackhorn, the sharp point of its horn pushing through my hand.”

The light in his eyes when he speaks of this feat unnerves me, as I can see in it hubris for the creations of men, which are but motes in God’s eye, but the meat counter isn’t the right forum for corrective sermons. It’s important that I sometimes am just another citizen, not a shepherd.”

“No, Golden Calf,” Good Stab corrected. “He cut that Black Robe’s throat, but he saved his book. It was his medicine from there on out. He would burn a handful of pages at the Sun Dance each year, less pages every year, and everyone would sing the words they remembered from that Black Robe.”
