“Or it’s a single, long night,” he said, looking the other way from the flickering candle, which I perceived was possibly still causing him slight injury.”

* <span meta="11.4@2025-09-15T03:45:59.855Z"></span> “It didn’t matter. I would be in the Sandhills already by then, in my lodge with my wives in their ermine and elk teeth, my children sleeping in a pile of robes, the smoke from the fire curling up and up, past the blackened ear-flaps and into the sky, silver lines of light always scratching across it.
Or so I thought.
This is my telling for today.
The pipe is empty.”

I walked over, fell to my knees, and pushed that eye shut, held it shut with both hands, and I looked all around, for who could have done a thing like this, which was when a greased-shooter hit me in the shoulder right here, from so far off I didn’t even hear its sound. It spun me ten paces into another blackhorn, the sharp point of its horn pushing through my hand.”

* <span meta="29.5@2025-09-17T02:23:19.412Z"></span> “According to him, whom I encountered at the butcher, that massive ship he’s so compelled by is currently chugging across the Atlantic. The light in his eyes when he speaks of this feat unnerves me, as I can see in it hubris for the creations of men, which are but motes in God’s eye, but the meat counter isn’t the right forum for corrective sermons. It’s important that I sometimes am just another citizen, not a shepherd.”

“No, Golden Calf,” Good Stab corrected. “He cut that Black Robe’s throat, but he saved his book. It was his medicine from there on out. He would burn a handful of pages at the Sun Dance each year, less pages every year, and everyone would sing the words they remembered from that Black Robe.”

* <span meta="69.2@2025-09-28T17:30:13.743Z"></span> (it picked up again) “You don’t understand,” I said pleadingly as if to a higher power, longing to use my hands to gesture with, to make him see, to get him to understand that these were different times, with a different breed of men——the kind necessary to forge a new land, a better country, one that made use of its resources rather than letting them lie fallow.”

* <span meta="85.2@2025-09-30T03:20:28.349Z"></span> “No great loss, there. They were just me trying to figure out if my “greatest”-grandfather was good or evil, wondering if Good Stab was Socrates to Arthur Beaucarne’s Plato, some deep dives into the microfichy waters, and a lot of notes chasing down antique vocabulary—which, I don’t know, this last one seems pretty meritorious to me, and not unfitting for a “Communications” professor.”

* <span meta="93.6@2025-09-30T04:45:39.126Z"></span> “I had neither rifle nor spurs for this expedition, however, and the castoff cavalryman’s uniform I had taken when my New Haven finery turned to rags was no protection from the elements. Yet I had no training, no sea legs for an effort such as this. I was like the man in the play who wakes with donkey ears, and so must bray around hopelessly.
