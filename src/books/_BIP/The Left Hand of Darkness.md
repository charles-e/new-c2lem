<blockquote>Amazon says, "A groundbreaking work of science fiction, The Left Hand of Darkness tells the story of a lone human emissary to Winter, an alien world whose inhabitants can choose—and change—their gender. His goal is to facilitate Winter's inclusion in a growing intergalactic civilization. But to do so he must bridge the gulf between his own views and those of the completely dissimilar culture that he encounters."

And I have to say that mostly I agree.  There is a good amount of well-crafted prose, the overall theme of the book is the differences between gendered human and Winter's mostly asexual psycholology.

<blockquote>“I’ll make my report as if I told a story, for I was taught as a child on my homeworld that Truth is a matter of the imagination. The soundest fact may fail or prevail in the style of its telling: like that singular organic jewel of our seas, which grows brighter as one woman wears it and, worn by another, dulls and goes to dust. Facts are no more solid, coherent, round, and real than pearls are. But both are sensitive.”
</blockquote>

My biggest complaint about the book is that it is dated by its milieu, its premise is that the Ekumen is a very kumbaya-singing star-spanning civilization: it is very much along the lines of the "the federation" from star trek in its very idealistic approach to meeting new civilizations

The sledge pulled like a feather, and we laughed with joy.”

But it was from the difference between us, not from the affinities and likenesses, but from the difference, that that love came: and it was itself the bridge, the only bridge, across what divided us. For us to meet sexually would be for us to meet once more as aliens. We had touched, in the only way we could touch. We left it at that. I do not know if we were right.”
