But cunts like this were sent to try you, and September meant work, only work. ‘I’ll come in or I won’t come in?’ he muttered, into his cap.

* <span meta="6@2025-06-20T20:36:42.932Z"></span> chapter 7 - Eliza at WA's wedding to Sarah W remembering another wedding.

* <span meta="9@2025-06-23T01:21:20.044Z"></span> OMG reading so carefully to keep track of our characters and relationships  - also WA is a goofball: “I’m a writer and I’ve no intention of being anything else.”
