“Chris nodded and said, "Yeah." Poetry had a lowering effect on him. Classical music too. Their cultural weight and solemnity and self-importance oppressed him. He suspected that people were subtly bullied into faking appreciation in order not to appear uneducated fools. Long ago he had proposed this to Harriet. She was so dismissive and irritated that he never mentioned it again. Among the craftsmen and women, marquee erectors and roadies he worked with, string quartets and sonnet sequences never came up.”

“What’s so weird as well as pitiful is that he looks like he always did, like his real self. As long as he’s not saying anything. He gets up, washes, sometimes even trims his beard. He puts on the clothes I set out for him. At breakfast he’s in his usual place, drinking coffee. I glance across at his lovely big face and I think it’s all been a bad dream. In a minute he’ll get up and kiss me. He’ll go out to his workshop to start on a commission. He looks at me and I imagine a gleam of mischief. He’s been pretending all along. It’s been a joke in bad taste. He was testing my love. Then he says, ‘When are they coming?’ When I fail to answer, he asks again. I go into the kitchen and start on the dishes. I know he’ll follow me in and ask, ‘What are you doing?’ It’s only seven thirty and there’s a whole day ahead. Nowhere to escape to, for me or for him. If I take him for a walk, he’ll ask, ‘Where are we going?’ If I tell him, he’ll forget and ask me again. But then he holds my hand and gives it a squeeze and I know I love him. I can never put him in a home. We’re both prisoners here.”

“Young people today dismiss the past for not having yet devised the pharmaceuticals they enjoy, though they could never tell you how they work.  As was noted long ago, we are all innocent children in the tall forest of our clever inventions.”


“ Until his cognitive decline, history knows nothing of Percy Greene’s faults. A close friend, the trumpeter in the Hotfoots and a doctor, said at Percy’s funeral, ‘Whatever natural substances occasionally surge through our brains to make us delighted and delightful, the endorphins, the serotonin etc, Percy had quantities all and every day to supply a small town. His daily allowance would be for us a lifetime’s high point. Call it virtue or genetic luck, we were privileged to be around him.’ ”

“A fiend had come in the night to take an ice cream scoop to my brain and made off with my darkest emotional flavours, fury, humiliation, self-pity, desolation. If they all came back at once, they would wreck me.”
