             There has fallen a splendid tear                 From the passion-flower at the gate.             She is coming, my dove, my dear;                 She is coming, my life, my fate;             The red rose cries, ‘She is near, she is near’;                 And the white rose weeps, ‘She is late’;             The larkspur listens, ‘I hear, I hear’;                 And the lily whispers, ‘I wait.”
