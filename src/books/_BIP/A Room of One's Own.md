* <span meta="11.8@2025-08-25T15:49:08.592Z"></span> “A book lay beside me and, opening it, I turned casually enough to Tennyson. And here I found Tennyson was singing:
             There has fallen a splendid tear                 From the passion-flower at the gate.             She is coming, my dove, my dear;                 She is coming, my life, my fate;             The red rose cries, ‘She is near, she is near’;                 And the white rose weeps, ‘She is late’;             The larkspur listens, ‘I hear, I hear’;                 And the lily whispers, ‘I wait.”

It was the face and the figure of Professor von X engaged in writing his monumental work entitled The Mental, Moral, and Physical Inferiority of the Female Sex. He was not in my picture a man attractive to women. He was heavily built; he had a great jowl; to balance that he had very small eyes; he was very red in the face. His expression suggested that he was labouring under some emotion that made him jab his pen on the paper as if he were killing some noxious insect as he wrote, but even when he had killed it that did not satisfy him; he must go on killing it; and even so, some cause for anger and irritation remained. Could it be his wife, I asked, looking at my picture? Was she in love with a cavalry officer?”
