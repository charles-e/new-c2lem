Only later would I understand: what seems like a lack of meaning—that’s the meaning. Every moment of “lack of meaning” is precisely the frightening certainty that that’s exactly what it means, and that not only can I not reach it, I don’t want to because I have no guarantees. The lack of meaning would only overwhelm me later. Could realizing the lack of meaning have always been my negative way of sensing the meaning? it had been my way of participating.”

In my fresh, damp and cozy home, the maid without telling me had opened a dry emptiness. Now it was an entirely clean and vibrant room as in an insane asylum from which dangerous objects have been removed.”

* <span meta="26.4@2025-12-21T16:20:19.504Z"></span> “From its bulk and slowness, it had to be a very old cockroach. With my archaic horror of cockroaches I’d learned to guess, even from a distance, their ages and dangers; even without ever having really looked a cockroach in the face I knew the ways they existed.”

* <span meta="26.3@2025-12-21T16:35:57.588Z"></span> “Up till then I’d never mastered my own powers—powers I neither understood nor wanted to understand, but the life inside me had hung on to them so that one day at last this unknown and happy and unconscious matter would unclasp what was finally: I! I, whatever that was.”

* <span meta="28.1@2025-12-24T21:18:24.204Z"></span> “And all of a sudden I moaned out loud, this time I heard my moan. Because rising to my surface like pus was my truest matter—and with fright and loathing I was feeling that “I-being” was coming from a source far prior to the human source and, with horror, much greater than the human.”


* <span meta="35@2025-12-24T21:54:33.153Z"></span> “To build a possible soul—a soul whose head does not devour its own tail—the law commands us to keep only to what is disguisedly alive. And the law commands that, whoever eats of the unclean, must do so unawares. Since whoever eats of the unclean knowing that it is unclean—will also know that the unclean is not unclean. Is that it?”

* <span meta="42.1@2025-12-29T15:21:30.642Z"></span> “ts two eyes were alive like two ovaries. It was looking at me with the blind fertility of its gaze. It was fertilizing my dead fertility. Would its eyes be salty? If I touched them—since I was gradually getting more and more unclean—if I touched them with my mouth, would they taste salty?”

“The joy of getting lost is a Sabbath joy. Getting lost is a dangerous finding. I was experiencing in that desert the fire of things: and it was a neutral fire. I was living from the tessitura of which things are made. And it was a hell, that place, because in that world where I was living neither compassion nor hope exists.”

* <span meta="56.1@2026-01-02T21:15:32.993Z"></span> “Sleep with me awake, and only thus can you know of my great sleep and know what is the living desert.”
