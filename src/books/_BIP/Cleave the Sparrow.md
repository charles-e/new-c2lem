<blockquote> And if you come from Silicon Valley, like Max Merchant and the other tech bros, there’s a certain ideology you probably ascribe to, called longtermism. LONGTERMISTS START with a reasonable premise: Let’s do the most good, for the most people—a fraught but classic utilitarian framing. Only here’s the twist. Longtermists believe in a future of countless digital beings, spread out across the Milky Way and galaxies far beyond. Their conservative estimate, over the next billion years or so, is that these digital humans can reach a total population of 10 to the 58th power—that’s a one with fifty-eight zeros. It’s a number so enormous, it makes our seventy quintillion planets estimate feel like the sad, sparse attendance at a Jamaican singing bowl concert. And for longtermists, it’s the big numbers that matter most.

The main character is pretty much an incel, the story's plot is a nihilist Rube Goldberg machine, BUT it is a fine excuse for a tour of philosophical and scientific baubles; it has coverage of quantum bayesianism, rationalism in its current silicon-valley-centric incarnation, and even Sperry's split brain experiments.  For a certain type of young male I am sure this book will scratch an itch and provide some chuckles.  And I plowed through it in a day, but my life is not changed.

Her Majesty laughed when I told her all this.”
