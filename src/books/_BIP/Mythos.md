* <span meta="8.3@2025-07-29T22:12:01.914Z"></span> “As all these unexpected new beings emerged alive from the blood-soaked ground, Kronos stared at them in disgust and scattered them with a sweep of his scythe. Next he turned to Gaia.”

* <span meta="8.5@2025-07-29T22:17:06.219Z"></span> “Kronos met these curses with a sneer and, corralling his mutilated father and newly freed mutant brothers at the point of his sickle, he led them down to Tartarus. The Hecatonchires and Cyclopes he imprisoned in the caves, but his father he buried even deeper, as far from his natural domain of the heavens as he could contrive”

* <span meta="15.2@2025-07-31T03:43:04.582Z"></span> “The shattered world was still smoking from the savagery of war. Zeus saw that it needed to heal and he knew that his own generation, the Third Order of divine beings, must manage better than the first two had done. It was time for a new order, an order purged of the wasteful bloodlust and elemental brutality that had marked earlier times.”
(in the last chapter we learned about the various nymphs, fates, muses, etc)

* <span meta="26.5@2025-08-02T00:55:35.162Z"></span> “Wave, Zeus. And for heaven’s sake, smile!’ Hera’s hissed undertone jerks him away.”

* <span meta="34.4@2025-08-03T21:17:57.074Z"></span> “And so death became a constant in human life, as it remains to this day. But the world of the Silver Age, it should be understood, was very different from our own. Gods, demigods and all kinds of immortals still walked amongst us. Intercourse of the personal, social and sexual kind with the gods was as normal to men and women of the Silver Age as intercourse with machines and AI assistants is to us today. And, I dare say, a great deal more fun.”

* <span meta="48.7@2025-08-08T00:53:52.347Z"></span> “Here Phaeton lies who in the sun-god’s chariot fared.
And though greatly he failed, more greatly he dared."

* <span meta="53.1@2025-08-08T20:33:48.822Z"></span> The birth of Dionysius - “The infant was suckled by the rain nymphs of Nysus;fn7 and, once weaned, was tutored by pot-bellied Silenus, who was to become his closest companion and follower – a kind of Falstaff to the young god’s Prince Hal. Silenus had his own train of followers too, the sileni – satyr-like creatures for ever associated with antic riot, rout and revelry.”

* <span meta="57.5@2025-08-09T00:12:24.241Z"></span> solecism - mistake: “Like Ixion before him he made the mistake of abusing Zeus’s hospitality, in his case by returning from a banquet on Olympus with stolen ambrosia and nectar in his pockets. He also committed the unpardonable solecism of telling tales about the private lives and mannerisms of the gods, amusing his courtiers and friends with insolent mimicry and gossip.”
