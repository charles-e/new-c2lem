* <span meta="10@2025-06-21T03:21:28.377Z"></span> So far, so charming (except for the Dog story)

* <span meta="23@2025-07-13T21:23:54.260Z"></span> The inner chamber was said to be haunted
* <span meta="31@2025-07-29T21:11:32.124Z"></span> “Having hurriedly sewn something, you’re rather pleased with how nicely you’ve done it – but then when you come to pull out the needle, you find that you forgot to knot the thread when you began. It’s also infuriating to discover you’ve sewn something inside out.

* <span meta="31.5@2025-07-31T02:49:03.881Z"></span> [92] Startling and disconcerting things – The way you feel when an ornamental comb that you’re in the process of polishing happens to bump against something and suddenly snaps.
An ox cart that’s overturned. You’ve assumed that something of such enormous bulk must of course be thoroughly stable, and you’re simply stunned to see it lying there, and deeply[…]”

My response was simply, ‘The flowers have already scattered.’ 1”

When they learned of my reply, a large group of senior courtiers who were seated in the Black Door room set about chanting this poem. His Majesty happened to overhear, and remarked, ‘This is a better response than merely writing a good poem. She’s made a fine answer.”
(can you imagine having everyone pay attention to you like this?)

* <span meta="36.3@2025-08-04T05:20:27.797Z"></span> “It’s most distressing to see someone thin and swarthy dressed in a see-through gossamer-silk shift.”

* <span meta="39.1@2025-08-06T02:48:27.434Z"></span> “[120] Awkward and pointless things – A large ship left beached by the tide. A great tree that’s blown over in the wind, and lies there on its side with its roots in the air.

* <span meta="39.6@2025-08-06T20:44:34.818Z"></span> “[124] It’s beautiful the way the water drops hang so thick and dripping on the garden plants after a night of rain in the ninth month, when the morning sun shines fresh and dazzling on them. Where the rain clings in the spider webs that hang in the open weave of a screening fence or draped on the eaves, it forms the most moving and beautiful strings of white pearly drops.

This was not only very entertaining, but also gave us a terrible start.”

‘Oh, you’re hopeless!’ said he, which amused me greatly.”
The end of a cute anecdote about the emperor hitting on our narrator.
