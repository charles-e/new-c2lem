It’s also infuriating to discover you’ve sewn something inside out.

* <span meta="31.5@2025-07-31T02:49:03.881Z"></span> [92] Startling and disconcerting things – The way you feel when an ornamental comb that you’re in the process of polishing happens to bump against something and suddenly snaps.
An ox cart that’s overturned. You’ve assumed that something of such enormous bulk must of course be thoroughly stable, and you’re simply stunned to see it lying there, and deeply[…]”

My response was simply, ‘The flowers have already scattered.’ 1”

My response was simply, ‘The flowers have already scattered.’ 1
When they learned of my reply, a large group of senior courtiers who were seated in the Black Door room set about chanting this poem. His Majesty happened to overhear, and remarked, ‘This is a better response than merely writing a good poem. She’s made a fine answer.”
(can you imagine having everyone pay attention to you like this?)

* <span meta="36.3@2025-08-04T05:20:27.797Z"></span> “It’s most distressing to see someone thin and swarthy dressed in a see-through gossamer-silk shift.”

* <span meta="39.1@2025-08-06T02:48:27.434Z"></span> “[120] Awkward and pointless things – A large ship left beached by the tide. A great tree that’s blown over in the wind, and lies there on its side with its roots in the air.
An inconsequential little man strutting about scolding a retainer.”

* <span meta="39.6@2025-08-06T20:44:34.818Z"></span> “[124] It’s beautiful the way the water drops hang so thick and dripping on the garden plants after a night of rain in the ninth month, when the morning sun shines fresh and dazzling on them. Where the rain clings in the spider webs that hang in the open weave of a screening fence or draped on the eaves, it forms the most moving and beautiful strings of white pearly drops.
I also love the way, when the sun has risen higher, the bush clover, all bowed down beneath the weight of the drops, will shed its dew, and a branch will suddenly spring up though no hand has touched it. And I also find it fascinating that things like this can utterly fail to delight others.”

* <span meta="40.4@2025-08-07T01:52:29.249Z"></span> “In response to this, the voice of the night-priest nearby suddenly broke in, rather angrily, ‘No no, that’s a very bad idea. Do keep talking all night, ladies.’
This was not only very entertaining, but also gave us a terrible start.”

‘Oh, you’re hopeless!’ said he, which amused me greatly.”
The end of a cute anecdote about the emperor hitting on our narrator.

* <span meta="44.4@2025-08-11T04:24:51.498Z"></span> “[144] Endearingly lovely things – A baby’s face painted on a gourd. A sparrow coming fluttering down to the nest when her babies are cheeping for her.
”

* <span meta="48.7@2025-08-17T17:59:06.083Z"></span> “[172]* One day in the ninth month, at a certain place, a gentleman who, though not exactly a court noble, was renowned at that time as a man of marvellous charm, taste and sensibility, pays a visit to Lady Someone. Dawn is breaking, thick mists diffuse the light of a glorious moon, and he bends all his powers to the task of producing words that will leave her heart aglow with memories of their night together. Ah, now he departs – she sits on and on, gazing into the distance after him. A scene of inexpressibly resonant beauty.”

* <span meta="48.7@2025-08-17T18:00:20.311Z"></span> “He makes as if to go on his way, but surreptitiously turns and retraces his steps to secrete himself by the lattice fence. Seeing her deep reluctance to rise and leave, he bethinks himself to say something further to her of what is in his heart, but now he hears her murmur softly to herself the lines:
‘though there in the dawn sky
the moon hangs bright’. 1
The woman he gazes at in secret is bending forward, so that her hair falls away from her head and hangs perhaps six inches before her face. It glows there like a candle, borrowing added light from the moonlight, and in astonishment at the sight the man chooses this moment to slip quietly away. 2
This was a tale that someone told.”

* <span meta="51@2025-08-17T19:13:39.123Z"></span> “It’s engaging to witness some very attractive young lady of eighteen or nineteen, with a beautiful sleek head of hair hanging the length of her back, wonderfully thick at the ends, a lovely plump figure and very pale face, who is suffering from a terrible toothache. She sits there, hand pressed to her bright red cheek, quite unaware that her side-locks are all sodden from weeping.”
