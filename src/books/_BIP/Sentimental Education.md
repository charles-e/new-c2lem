Is it possible?”And she was seized with a fit of nervous trembling.“Why is this? Does it mean that I love him?”Then all of a sudden:“Why, yes; I love him—I love him!”It seemed to her as if she were sinking into endless depths. The clock struck three. She listened to the vibrations of the sounds as they died away. And she remained on the edge of the armchair, with her eyes fixed and an unchanging smile on her face.”

[First time we get Ms Arnoux POV?]

* <span meta="57@2025-07-25T19:16:23.251Z"></span> “For the first time in his life Frédéric felt himself beloved; and this new pleasure, which did not transcend the ordinary run of agreeable sensations, made him swell with so much emotion that he spread out his two arms and flung back his head.A large cloud passed across the sky.“It is going towards Paris,” said Louise. “You’d like to follow it—wouldn’t you?”“I! Why?”“Who knows?”And surveying him with a sharp look:“Perhaps you have there” (she searched her mind for the appropriate phrase) “something to engage your affections.”“Oh! I have nothing to engage my affections there.”“Are you perfectly certain?”“Why, yes, Mademoiselle, perfectly certain!”

* <span meta="61@2025-07-27T03:50:19.171Z"></span> “For, indeed, you are not happy any more than I am! Oh! I know you. You have no one who responds to your craving for affection, for devotion. I will do anything you wish! I will not offend you! I swear to you that I will not!”And he let himself fall on his knees, in spite of himself, giving way beneath the weight of the feelings that oppressed his heart.“Get up!” she said; “get up, I insist!”And she declared in an imperious tone that if he did not comply with her wish, she would never see him again.”

She was waiting there for something the nature of which was not quite clear, but which, nevertheless, was of great importance; and, without knowing why, she was afraid of being seen. But an accursed little dog kept barking at her furiously and biting at the hem of her dress. He kept stubbornly coming back again and again, always barking more violently than before. Madame Arnoux woke up. The dog’s barking continued. She strained her ears to listen. It came from her son’s room. She rushed there in her bare feet. It was the child himself who was coughing. His hands were burning, his face flushed, and his voice strangely hoarse. Every minute he found it more difficult to breathe freely. She waited there till daybreak, bent over the coverlet watching him.”

The Republic is being double-crossed!” He was dissatisfied with everything, and especially with the fact that we had not taken back our natural frontiers.”
I think this is supposed to be funny.
