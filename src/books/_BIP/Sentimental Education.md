blah blah blah

Is it possible?”And she was seized with a fit of nervous trembling.“Why is this? Does it mean that I love him?”Then all of a sudden:“Why, yes; I love him—I love him!”It seemed to her as if she were sinking into endless depths. The clock struck three. She listened to the vibrations of the sounds as they died away. And she remained on the edge of the armchair, with her eyes fixed and an unchanging smile on her face.”

[First time we get Ms Arnoux POV?]

* <span meta="57@2025-07-25T19:16:23.251Z"></span> “For the first time in his life Frédéric felt himself beloved; and this new pleasure, which did not transcend the ordinary run of agreeable sensations, made him swell with so much emotion that he spread out his two arms and flung back his head.A large cloud passed across the sky.“It is going towards Paris,” said Louise. “You’d like to follow it—wouldn’t you?”“I! Why?”“Who knows?”And surveying him with a sharp look:“Perhaps you have there” (she searched her mind for the appropriate phrase) “something to engage your affections.”“Oh! I have nothing to engage my affections there.”“Are you perfectly certain?”“Why, yes, Mademoiselle, perfectly certain!”

* <span meta="61@2025-07-27T03:50:19.171Z"></span> “For, indeed, you are not happy any more than I am! Oh! I know you. You have no one who responds to your craving for affection, for devotion. I will do anything you wish! I will not offend you! I swear to you that I will not!”And he let himself fall on his knees, in spite of himself, giving way beneath the weight of the feelings that oppressed his heart.“Get up!” she said; “get up, I insist!”And she declared in an imperious tone that if he did not comply with her wish, she would never see him again.”
- Fred making moves
* <span meta="63@2025-07-27T17:41:52.560Z"></span> “The night before, she had dreamed that she had been, for some time, on the sidewalk of the Rue Tronchet. She was waiting there for something the nature of which was not quite clear, but which, nevertheless, was of great importance; and, without knowing why, she was afraid of being seen. But an accursed little dog kept barking at her furiously and biting at the hem of her dress. He kept stubbornly coming back again and again, always barking more violently than before. Madame Arnoux woke up. The dog’s barking continued. She strained her ears to listen. It came from her son’s room. She rushed there in her bare feet. It was the child himself who was coughing. His hands were burning, his face flushed, and his voice strangely hoarse. Every minute he found it more difficult to breathe freely. She waited there till daybreak, bent over the coverlet watching him.”

* <span meta="67@2025-07-27T19:10:23.249Z"></span> “The Citizen spent his days wandering about the streets, pulling his moustache, rolling his eyes about, accepting and propagating any dismal news that was communicated to him; and he had only two phrases: “Look out! we’re going to be out flanked!” or else, “Why, dammit! The Republic is being double-crossed!” He was dissatisfied with everything, and especially with the fact that we had not taken back our natural frontiers.”
I think this is supposed to be funny.
* <span meta="72.3@2025-07-29T21:46:40.686Z"></span> “On the following day they went to see the Wolf’s Gorge, the Fairies’ Pool, the Long Rock, and the Marlotte. Two days later, they began again at random, just as their coachman thought fit to drive them, without asking where they were, and often even neglecting the famous sites.”
Places in Fountainbleu -- sounds nice
* <span meta="73.6@2025-07-30T00:00:54.216Z"></span> “Oh! oh! I may have been!” wishing to convey in this way that he had been often fortunate in his love-affairs, so that she might have a better opinion of him, just as Rosanette did not avow how many lovers she had had, in order that he might have more respect for her—for there will always be found in the midst of the most intimate confidences restrictions, false shame, delicacy, and pity. You divine either in the other or in yourself precipices or muddy paths which prevent you from penetrating any farther; moreover, you feel that you will not be understood. It is hard to express accurately the thing you mean, whatever it may be; and this is the reason why perfect unions are rare.”
- Finally, something is happening

* <span meta="74.3@2025-07-30T01:08:39.756Z"></span> “He started at a running pace from the Quai Voltaire. At an open window an old man in his shirtsleeves was crying, with his eyes raised. The Seine glided peacefully along. The sky was of a clear blue; and in the trees round the Tuileries birds were singing.”

* <span meta="75.9@2025-07-30T01:25:19.321Z"></span> “Then came the painter, the earthenware dealer, and Mademoiselle Louise; and, thanks to Martinon, who had taken his place to be near Cécile, Frédéric found himself beside Madame Arnoux.”
(fred is such a dick)
