Jim Dixon, lecturer in history (stalky & wide; chubby) and his music-obsessed boss Professor Welch (tall and weedy, lank white hair) 

* <span meta="2.7@2025-10-13T03:09:08.806Z"></span> “Welch had been flicking water from his hands, a movement he now arrested. He looked like an African savage being shown a simple conjuring trick. He said: 'Coffee-time?”

* <span meta="5.9@2025-10-13T03:09:45.064Z"></span> “He half-listened for a minute or so while Margaret described how good Mrs Welch had been to her in fetching her from the hospital and installing her at the Welches' home to convalesce. She had undoubtedly been very kind to Margaret, even though at other times, when publicly disagreeing with her husband for example, she was the only living being capable of making Dixon sympathize with him.”
