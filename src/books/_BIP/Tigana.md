Some guy on tiktok says this is better than Rothfuss's "Name of the Wind" and I guess I am going to find out.

* <span meta="21.2@2026-01-08T17:13:21.072Z"></span> “He didn’t want these people hurt. In any way at all. His excitement quite gone, Devin had driven home for him, for the first time, this one among the many ancillary sorrows that lay on the road he seemed to have found. He was brought face to face with the distance that road imposed between them and, it now seemed, almost everyone they might meet. Even friends. Even people who might share a part or all of their dream. He thought of Catriana in the palace again, and he understood her even more now than he had an hour ago.”
