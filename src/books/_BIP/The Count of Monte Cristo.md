At the same time, her arms, naked to the elbow, arms that were tanned but otherwise seemed modelled on those of the Venus of Arles, trembled with a sort of feverish impatience, and she was tapping the ground with her supple, well-made foot, revealing a leg that was shapely, bold and proud, but imprisoned in a red cotton stocking patterned in grey and blue lozenges”
 
A young and beautiful girl, with hair as black as jet, her eyes as velvety as the gazelles, was leaning with her back against the wainscot, rubbing in her slender fingers, moulded after the antique style, a bunch of heath-blossoms, the flowers of which she was picking off and strewing on the floor; her arms bare to the elbow, tanned, and resembling those of the Venus at Arles, moved with a kind of restless impatience, and she tapped the earth with her pliant and well-formed foot so as to display the pure and full shape of her well-turned leg, in its red cotton stocking with grey and blue clocks.

* <span meta="6.4@2025-09-01T20:09:18.711Z"></span> “Why, then, they shall be breached,’ said M. de Salvieux. ‘Was he himself so scrupulous, when it came to shooting the poor Duc d’Enghien?’8”

* <span meta="6.8@2025-09-01T20:31:15.467Z"></span> Villefort swears he will be pityless to his mom(?) but hints to his fiance that he will be merciful.

* <span meta="6.9@2025-09-02T22:20:15.756Z"></span> “In reality, apart from the memory of his father’s choice of political allegiance (which, if he did not himself completely renounce it, might affect his own career), Gérard de Villefort was at that moment as happy as it is possible for a man to be. At the age of twenty-six, already wealthy in his own right, he held a high office in the legal profession; and he was to marry a beautiful young woman whom he loved, not with passion, but reasonably, as a deputy crown prosecutor may love.”

* <span meta="6.1@2025-09-02T23:00:58.844Z"></span> This is ominous tho: 
'Alas! alas!' murmured he, 'if the procureur du roi had been here in Marseilles, I should have been ruined. This accursed letter would have destroyed all my hopes. Oh! father, must your past career always interfere with mine?
Suddenly a light passed over his face, a smile played round his mouth, and his lips relaxed."This will do”, said he, “and from this letter, which might have ruined me, I will make my fortune.”

* <span meta="7.1@2025-09-08T02:48:45.446Z"></span> Danglars alone was happy and contented, he had got rid of an enemy and preserved his situation on board the Pharaon; Danglars was one of those men born with a pen behind the ear, and an inkstand in place of a heart. Everything with him was multiplication or subtraction, and he estimated the life of a man as less precious than a figure, when that figure could increase and that life diminish the total of the amount.

* <span meta="19.1@2025-10-06T18:50:12.265Z"></span> I did not buy Edmond’s broken ribs nor did I buy that anyone else would have bought that.  But whatever: TS has a new album.

* <span meta="19.7@2025-10-09T06:36:01.239Z"></span> Thus the Genoese, subtle as he was, was duped by Edmond who in his favour had a mild demeanour, nautical skill, and admirable dissimulation.

* <span meta="20.9@2025-10-11T00:29:15.160Z"></span> His naturally sallow complexion had assumed a still further shade of brown from the habit the unfortunate man had acquired of remaining from early morn till latest eve at the threshold of his door, in eager hope that some traveller, either equestrian or pedestrian might bless his eyes, and give him the delight of once more seeing a guest enter his doors. But his patience and his expectations were alike vain. Yet there he stood, day after day, exposed to the rays of a burning sun, with no other protection for his head than a red handkerchief twisted around it in the manner of the Spanish muleteers. This anxious, careworn innkeeper was no other than our old acquaintance, Caderousse

* <span meta="24.9@2025-10-20T20:13:20.466Z"></span> Morrel is saved! I don't get why we had to have Dantes show up twice to make this happen?  (then again, I haven't spent a great deal of brain power contemplating this.) Anyway Eddie says he is done playing secret santa.

'you heard our repast announced; will you now take the trouble to enter the salle-à-manger, your humble servant going first to show the way?
(The banquet hosted by Amphitryon is famously marked by a mythological twist in which Zeus, disguised as Amphitryon, gives a grand feast in Amphitryon’s likeness while the real Amphitryon is away. When Amphitryon returns home, a dispute arises over who is truly the host—the man physically present or the god who provided the feast. The guests and servants resolve this by deciding that the true host is he who gave the feast, highlighting the importance of hospitality and generosity in ancient culture. This banquet story emphasizes themes of identity, deception, and honor, with the act of hosting being a symbol of social status and control over the household.​)

I know all that, for it is with the justice of all countries that I have occupied myself - it is with the criminal procedure of all nations that I have compared natural justice, and I must say, sir, that it is the law of primitive nations; that is, the law of retaliation that I have most frequently found to be according to the law of God.

'What have you discovered?' asked Morrel.
'T have just discovered the method of ridding a gardener of the dormice that eat his peaches.?

Morrel was only thirty-one, Barrois was sixty years of age; Morrel was deeply in love, and Barrois was dying of heat and exertion. These two men, thus opposed in age and interests, resembled two parts of a triangle, presenting the extremes of separation, yet possessing their point of union. This point of union was Noirtier, and it was he who had just sent for Morrel with the request that he would Waste no time in coming to him, - a command which Morrel obeyed to the letter, to the great discomfiture of Barrois.
