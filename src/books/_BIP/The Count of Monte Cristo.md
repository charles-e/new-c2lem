At the same time, her arms, naked to the elbow, arms that were tanned but otherwise seemed modelled on those of the Venus of Arles, trembled with a sort of feverish impatience, and she was tapping the ground with her supple, well-made foot, revealing a leg that was shapely, bold and proud, but imprisoned in a red cotton stocking patterned in grey and blue lozenges”
 
A young and beautiful girl, with hair as black as jet, her eyes as velvety as the gazelles, was leaning with her back against the wainscot, rubbing in her slender fingers, moulded after the antique style, a bunch of heath-blossoms, the flowers of which she was picking off and strewing on the floor; her arms bare to the elbow, tanned, and resembling those of the Venus at Arles, moved with a kind of restless impatience, and she tapped the earth with her pliant and well-formed foot so as to display the pure and full shape of her well-turned leg, in its red cotton stocking with grey and blue clocks.

* <span meta="6.4@2025-09-01T20:09:18.711Z"></span> “Why, then, they shall be breached,’ said M. de Salvieux. ‘Was he himself so scrupulous, when it came to shooting the poor Duc d’Enghien?’8”

* <span meta="6.8@2025-09-01T20:31:15.467Z"></span> Villefort swears he will be pityless to his mom(?) but hints to his fiance that he will be merciful.

* <span meta="6.9@2025-09-02T22:20:15.756Z"></span> “In reality, apart from the memory of his father’s choice of political allegiance (which, if he did not himself completely renounce it, might affect his own career), Gérard de Villefort was at that moment as happy as it is possible for a man to be. At the age of twenty-six, already wealthy in his own right, he held a high office in the legal profession; and he was to marry a beautiful young woman whom he loved, not with passion, but reasonably, as a deputy crown prosecutor may love.”

* <span meta="6.1@2025-09-02T23:00:58.844Z"></span> This is ominous tho: 
'Alas! alas!' murmured he, 'if the procureur du roi had been here in Marseilles, I should have been ruined. This accursed letter would have destroyed all my hopes. Oh! father, must your past career always interfere with mine?
Suddenly a light passed over his face, a smile played round his mouth, and his lips relaxed."This will do”, said he, “and from this letter, which might have ruined me, I will make my fortune.”

* <span meta="7.1@2025-09-08T02:48:45.446Z"></span> Danglars alone was happy and contented, he had got rid of an enemy and preserved his situation on board the Pharaon; Danglars was one of those men born with a pen behind the ear, and an inkstand in place of a heart. Everything with him was multiplication or subtraction, and he estimated the life of a man as less precious than a figure, when that figure could increase and that life diminish the total of the amount.

by which it can be learned; it is the amalgamation of all the

sciences, the golden cloud which bears the soul to heaven?
