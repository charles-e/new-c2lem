<blockquote>
Someday, I would like to write a book that isn't about Rick Chambers or Astarte. It would be the sort of book George Eliot could have written, about life in a country town and the people who live there, their jealousies, their ambitions, the minutiae of their lives. How they fall in love with the wrong people, or the right people at the wrong time, or lose the mercantile business on which their fortune is built. Or misplace wills. You know, literature.

But I've never experienced any of those things myself. All I know is monsters.
