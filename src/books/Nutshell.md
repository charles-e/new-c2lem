Cybil recommended this after I finished [What We Can Know](../../../books/What_We_Can_Know/).  Our narrator is a fetus whose observations are entirely too canny, acidic and clever while his mother and her lover plot to kill the estranged father.  Now that I think about it this should be narrated by Seth MacFarlane in Stewie's voice.

<blockquote>
NOW, TO MY FATHER, John Cairncross, a big man, my genome’s other half, whose helical twists of fate concern me greatly. It’s in me alone that my parents forever mingle, sweetly, sourly, along separate sugar-phosphate backbones, the recipe for my essential self. I also blend John and Trudy in my daydreams – like every child of estranged parents, I long to remarry them, this base pair, and so unite my circumstances to my genome.
</blockquote>

Another novel that features poetry along with dark human behavior, both nestled in clever prose.

They tell each other to be calm and patient, remind each other of the cost of their plan’s miscarriage, that there are several stages, that each must interlock, that if any single one fails, then all must fail ‘like old-fashioned Christmas tree lights’ – this impenetrable simile from Claude, who rarely says anything obscure. What they intend sickens and frightens them, and they can never speak of it directly. Instead, wrapped in whispers are ellipses, euphemisms, mumbled aporia followed by throat-clearing and a brisk change of subject.”

* <span meta="14.5@2025-11-18T01:27:25.542Z"></span> “Courtesy, if not clinical judgement, demands it. I close my eyes, I grit my gums, I brace myself against the uterine walls. This turbulence would shake the wings off a Boeing. My mother goads her lover, whips him on with her fairground shrieks. Wall of Death! On each occasion, on every piston stroke, I dread that he’ll break through and shaft my soft-boned skull and seed my thoughts with his essence, with the teeming cream of his banality.”

‘Names to conjure with,’ says Claude.
This is my Elodie problem. What is she doing here? She dances like a wild Corybant, in and out of focus. ”

Afterwards, he set the assignment for the week ahead – a poem in four stanzas of trochaic tetrameters catalectic. We laughed at this gobbledegook. He had us singing an example, a nursery rhyme. “Boys and girls come out to play.” Then he recited from memory Auden’s “Autumn Song”. “Now the leaves are falling fast, / Nurse’s flowers will not last.”
