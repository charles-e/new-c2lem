My brother-in-law, bless his aspirational hippie heart, gave me this book last Christmas.  I waited four months to start reading it when my guilt told me it was time.  Now having been nibbling at it for four more months I will officially retire from reading it.  

Much like reading [The Pillow Book](/books/Pillow_Book/), this is beautifully written and has no plot to drive you forward; its the sort of book you can keep in the bathroom to just pick up while you take care of business.  But where the Pillow Book is a mostly pleasant, if somewhat dull book about finding pleasure in medieval Japan, this book is a melancholy read because, even as it describes beauty in nature the driving theme of this work is the destruction of America's natural habitat. Importantly, this book was published in 1949 so when it describes a long standing trend of environmental degradation it was a trend 75 years ago and really nothing has improved that I can see. 

A big memory of the book is that Mr Leopold went camping at a time when much of America's wilderness was only accessible on foot, horseback or canoe.  And he describes being camped for months at a time feeding himself largely by hunting and fishing.  Another memory is a little essay where he describes his idea of a good hobby for him: bow hunting with a homemade bow and arrows!  

Anyway if you are really interested in this book, [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Sand_County_Almanac) has you covered.

An enormous amount of some kind of motive power has been lost.
It is easy to say that the loss is all in our minds eye, but is there any sober ecologist who will agree?
He knows full well that there has been an ecological death, the significance of which is inexpressible in terms of contemporary science. A philosopher has called this imponderable essence the numenon of material things. It stands in contradistinction to phe-nomenon, which is ponderable and predictable, even to the tossings and turnings of the remotest star.
The grouse is the numenon of the north woods, the blue jay of the hickory groves, the whisky-jack

* <span meta="60@2025-08-09T03:49:46.493Z"></span> (Clandeboye is a town just north of Manitoba, Canada) Some day my marsh, dyked and pumped, will lie forgotten under the wheat, just as today and yesterday will lie forgotten under the years. Before the last mud-minnow makes his last wiggle in the last pool, the terns will scream goodbye to Clandeboye, the swans will circle skyward in snowy dignity, and the cranes will blow their trumpets in farewell.

I am willing to rise up and declare my belief that this text is literally true; true forward, true backward, true even before breakfast. The man who cannot enjoy his leisure is ignorant, though his degrees exhaust the alphabet, and the man who does enjoy his leisure is to some extent educated, though he has never seen the inside of a school.
