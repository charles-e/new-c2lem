The setting is the old, but mostly civilized, west of 1912 where an indian starts showing up on Sundays at Arthur Beaucarne's Lutheran church in Miles City Montana. The indian wants to confess his many murders and Arthur accepts the task of giving this savage an ear as part of his clerical duty and (we eventually learn) because of a guilty conscience.  The indian's name is "Good Stab" and is wearing sunglasses because of an “eye condition” so Arthur dims the church to candle light. Good Stab’s story will drag out over several Sunday sessions.  

Meanwhile the corpses start showing up in the prairie on the outskirts of the city. The corpses are all mutilated and skinned.   It's not a coincidence that Good Stab has chosen Beaucarne to hear his story. Over the course of the narrative it becomes clear that Good Stab is a vampire and he has grievances over what became of his tribe and the buffalo over the last 75 years. 

I wanted to like this book, I liked the cover and the ambition of the book, to have a vampire story set in the mostly settled Montana of 1912, where the vampire is taking revenge for the colonial destruction of his culture, his family, his tribe and also for the near extinction of the Buffalo.  But, to summarize, while I finished the book, no, I didn’t love it.  

What worked:

Our vampire, “Good Stab” is a sad, aggrieved vampire and the book describes vividly the brutality of how the aboriginal people were treated, the mechanical techniques used to slaughter the buffalo, so we can feel the agony with him.  The most important, specific grievance is the massacre of his village, that takes place in 1839 in which Beaucarne is a bit player (why Good Stab is “confessing” in Beaucarne’s church)   

The book, of course, has its own set of rules for the vampire, for example in this story the vampire will take on attributes of its food, for example if it feeds on deer it will grow antlers, which found interesting (but then again I have not read *that* many vampire novels…)

What didn’t work:

I did not find the setting, Miles City Montana to feel very vivid: It was always kind of soft focus in spite of it being the setting for half the plot.

When the book tells Good Stab’s story it frequently uses blackfoot terminology, especially for the names of animals: It was confusing and distracting to keep track of "wags-his-tail" (deer), "dirty face" (mouse) and several others, I believe the use of blackfoot vocabulary was fine for adding verisimilitude to the story but, on the other hand, this ain't Shakespeare, the author could've thrown us some context clues to reduce cognitive “friction” for the reader.

And the biggest problem: midway through the book we are aware that the target for Good Stab’s retribution is  Beaucarne.  But then, apparently, Good Stab decides, to just stalk, to toy with his prey and we get many pages where Beaucarne is just waiting in dread for his fate to be decided and while that might be more frightening for Beaucarne it was boring for me. I found that region of the plot to be long and tedious to the point where I stopped reading for about a week.

What also (finally) worked:
 
After I returned to the story I didn't have to read too much more before I got to the final chapter told in 2013 by Beaucarne’s great, great, great granddaughter who gets to tie up the loose ends in the story and the last 20 pages of the book is its best part where our modern day protagonist has to arrange a final resolution for a vampire, in a madcap, macabre, macgyverish, improvised sequence of violence.  For me, it was this last part of the book that rescued the story.

* <span meta="11.4@2025-09-15T03:45:59.855Z"></span> “It didn’t matter. I would be in the Sandhills already by then, in my lodge with my wives in their ermine and elk teeth, my children sleeping in a pile of robes, the smoke from the fire curling up and up, past the blackened ear-flaps and into the sky, silver lines of light always scratching across it.
Or so I thought.
This is my telling for today.
The pipe is empty.”

* <span meta="27.4@2025-09-16T05:17:01.612Z"></span> “Beside me, one of the dead blackhorn’s eyes was open. It was staring at me.
I walked over, fell to my knees, and pushed that eye shut, held it shut with both hands, and I looked all around, for who could have done a thing like this, which was when a greased-shooter hit me in the shoulder right here, from so far off I didn’t even hear its sound. It spun me ten paces into another blackhorn, the sharp point of its horn pushing through my hand.”

* <span meta="29.5@2025-09-17T02:23:19.412Z"></span> “According to him, whom I encountered at the butcher, that massive ship he’s so compelled by is currently chugging across the Atlantic. The light in his eyes when he speaks of this feat unnerves me, as I can see in it hubris for the creations of men, which are but motes in God’s eye, but the meat counter isn’t the right forum for corrective sermons. It’s important that I sometimes am just another citizen, not a shepherd.”

* <span meta="65.8@2025-09-19T23:04:08.047Z"></span> (I like the concept of this book but I am bored.)
“No, Golden Calf,” Good Stab corrected. “He cut that Black Robe’s throat, but he saved his book. It was his medicine from there on out. He would burn a handful of pages at the Sun Dance each year, less pages every year, and everyone would sing the words they remembered from that Black Robe.”

* <span meta="69.2@2025-09-28T17:30:13.743Z"></span> (it picked up again) “You don’t understand,” I said pleadingly as if to a higher power, longing to use my hands to gesture with, to make him see, to get him to understand that these were different times, with a different breed of men——the kind necessary to forge a new land, a better country, one that made use of its resources rather than letting them lie fallow.”

* <span meta="85.2@2025-09-30T03:20:28.349Z"></span> “No great loss, there. They were just me trying to figure out if my “greatest”-grandfather was good or evil, wondering if Good Stab was Socrates to Arthur Beaucarne’s Plato, some deep dives into the microfichy waters, and a lot of notes chasing down antique vocabulary—which, I don’t know, this last one seems pretty meritorious to me, and not unfitting for a “Communications” professor.”

* <span meta="93.6@2025-09-30T04:45:39.126Z"></span> “I had neither rifle nor spurs for this expedition, however, and the castoff cavalryman’s uniform I had taken when my New Haven finery turned to rags was no protection from the elements. Yet I had no training, no sea legs for an effort such as this. I was like the man in the play who wakes with donkey ears, and so must bray around hopelessly.
