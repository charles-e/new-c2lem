Difficult 19th century sentences and unfamiliar Wessex dialect is challenging. The
story of Bathsheba Everdene, a headstrong, impulsive, misbehaving, mistaken sheep
and her long suffering but competent shepherd Gabriel Oak is not politically,
correctly modern. However the main characters are vividly enjoyable while the
descriptions of country life and scenery are poetic and the minor characters are amusing. The plot twists were kinda spectacular as were the brief romantic interludes between our hero and his love.
