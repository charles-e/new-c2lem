Not normally my sort of book (it is romantic sappy, mostly sad at this point, fantasy about teenagers) but I am here because _White_Cat_Black_Dog_ got me.  However at around 15% I have no regrets.... Now at 100% still no regrets: a year after three close friends mysteriously disappear from their cozy seaside town they are returned from the dead by their nerdy music teacher who is somehow also a wizard who, besides the resurrection, also rewrites reality so that they "were in Ireland on a music scholarship." The friends are forbidden to tell others about their new reality, challenged to learn to use magic (as having been resurrected they are, in fact, magical) and to discover how and why they died.  Then a capricious goddess gets involved and chaos ensues...  Anyway, this is a big, warm melodrama about the persistence of love in all its flavors be it romantic, familial, platonic, gay, straight whatever. I am failing to do this book justice.
