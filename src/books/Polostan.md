Another fun unique book from Mr Stephenson, who manages to never reinvent the wheel but instead swings between wildly different settings and stories with each new publication. Our plucky, athletic, pretty protagonist, Dawn, was born in Montana to a communist-activist father and an anarchist mother. The principal action is of an 18yo Dawn in 1933. The story has preoccupations with polo (hence the name of the book), Bonnie and Clyde, communism, the 1933 worlds fair in Chicago, and the incipient discoveries in radiation and atomic chemistry that will eventually lead to the atom bomb. The book is merely the opening salvo of what I anticipate to be a very interesting trilogy.
