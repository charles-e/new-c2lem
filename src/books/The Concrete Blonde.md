Did Harry Bosch kill the wrong man when he tried to arrest the seeming Dollmaker Serial Killer?  The LAPD is
being sued for wrongful death by the widow of the seeming killer and then the department receives a note
revealing the location of another alleged victim found buried in concrete.  The note's author seems to know
police secrets about the Dollmaker murders.  Suspicion falls on the officers on the dollmaker task
force and  the people who interacted with them.  Bosch has to solve the case by night while sitting in
court during the day having his character assassinated.
This one was a little contrived but I can see why the series has dozens of published novels.
