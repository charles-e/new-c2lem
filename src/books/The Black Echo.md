This was read by Titus Welliver the actor in the Amazon series. I did not like the series for a variety of reasons, amongst those reasons: I think Mr Welliver is just too handsome for the role.  But its a cheesy hardboiled detective story with a great deal of grit that comes from its setting: LA and as a narrator Mr. Welliver was just fine.  The plot revolves around a bank robbery committed by Vietnam
veteran tunnel-rats and it takes place in the late 1980s.  So this is a dated, fun look back at life before cell phones, when the Vietnamese population of LA (OC-really) was still novel and AIDs was a big deal.  I enjoyed.
