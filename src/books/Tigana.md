Some guy on tiktok says this is better than Rothfuss's "Name of the Wind" and began reading this to find out.  What I found out is that this is a much more ambitious novel than Rothfuss.  But I also found that it was slow and I lost patience with it. It seemed like each time the plot began to move forward it decided to digress to some new aspect of the world (or the struggle of the protagonist). Or maybe the problem was me and that I am a little burned out with reading.  Anyway with about a hundred pages left I bailed out and skip, skip, skipped ahead hoping for some traction which I never found.  So sadly, in spite of interesting likeable characters and strong verbiage, I am outta here.

His excitement quite gone, Devin had driven home for him, for the first time, this one among the many ancillary sorrows that lay on the road he seemed to have found. He was brought face to face with the distance that road imposed between them and, it now seemed, almost everyone they might meet. Even friends. Even people who might share a part or all of their dream. He thought of Catriana in the palace again, and he understood her even more now than he had an hour ago.”
