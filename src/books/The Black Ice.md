Another early (#2) Bosch novel; this one starts as a police suicide but Bosch suspects more is involved.  Eventually the plot revolves around
Mexican drug ("black-ice" = tar-heroin+PCP) smuggling.  Much of the action takes place in Calexico/Mexicali.  Again this is a dated pre-cellphone
plot but still fun.
