Abbott, a passive, insulated, isolated 25 year old uber driver of his father’s shiny new white Escalade, is convinced by desperate by a 30yo woman (and a $100k dollars payment) to deliver a large box from california to virginia in three days to arrive by July fourth. He can’t bring his phone or know what is inside the box because neither does the passenger (named Ether), though she insists the job is “totally legitimate, legal, safe, normal”. Through a series of coincidences, one of Abbott’s twitch followers (his only friends are from is twitch show) discovers that he is on this mission (I forget exactly) and is convinced that the box might be radioactive. (Ridiculous, I know, but Mr Pargin pulled it off and/or I am a gullible listener) The journey is documented and debated in a subreddit, hijinx ensue and eventually the Escalade is destroyed.
This is a funny yet touching satire about internet conspiracy culture and growing up. The ending hour fizzled a little bit but still, I cranked through all 16ish hours of it over three days where I was not simply driving (my normal MO for audio books)
