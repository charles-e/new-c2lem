Nick Harkaway has picked up beautifully where dad left off with the George Smiley Espionage Universe, given the large existing Smiley-Canon you probably come to this book with high hopes and think those hopes are fulfilled.  But if you are coming in cold well, this was a fun listen, its a good story told with original, clever, evocative prose. As well the narrator does a great job with voices, its a great production.  
The setting: George should be retired in 1963, but a Russian agent has appeared out of the blue in London where has been undercover for years and immediately is in the wind fleeing his russian bosses.  In spite of Smiley's retired status Control wants him to interview Suzsanna, a hungarian emigre and secretary to the fugitive spy in hopes of finding to spy in order to flip him.
