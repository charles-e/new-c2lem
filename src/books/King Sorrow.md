A group of mostly 20 year old  adults at a New England college decide to help their less privileged friend who is being blackmailed by a couple of drug dealing thugs.  And of course their "help" turns out to be an occult summoning (and ritual binding) of a dragon.  They agree that in return for killing the blackmailers on their behalf they will provide a new target for the dragon (who the kids named "King Sorrow") to kill every easter.  The rest of the book concerns how the group ages from easter to easter and the ramifications of the dragon killings.

The narrative starts in 1989 and does not complete until 2022. The characters are mostly believable and take some interesting character journeys (including dying.)  Likewise the narrative takes you through brief sketches of pop culture.  So overall you have long term soap opera with likeable characters, something for everybody and you just want to understand how the kids will somehow get free of the curse they unleashed. 

Fun read.

There were only five other volumes encased in human hide in all of New England: two at Harvard, one in the Boston Athenaeum, one at Dartmouth, one at UMO. Arthur, who loved a good word when he came across one—he chewed on them like caramels—even knew the formal term for such books, anthropodermic bibliopegy, language both scientific and somehow vaguely dirty, as if it described a perversion instead of an object.”

            invented a whole made-up history for him, full of intentional errors and rubbish. Then they tried to contact him with a séance.
            Only it worked. Philip could make the table levitate. He could dim the lights, slam the shutters on the windows, drop the
            temperature by ten, twenty degrees. This is all true—look it up. Never debunked. My granddad repeated the experiments with
            his research group in Langley. They dreamt up a fun-loving ghost of their own named Corporal Elwood Hondo.”

You haven’t tasted sorrow till you’ve tried prison cafeteria turkey.” This time the laughter was almost raucous. His mother had always been good at this, at finding her way to the words others needed to hear. “You don’t have to be in prison to feel trapped. You don’t have to receive a sentence to feel like you’re serving life. Most of us weren’t free before we were locked up. We were already serving time, the worst kind of time, locked away with our own guilt while doing things that made us hate ourselves. Your own head can be solitary confinement. But here we are now, and it’s Thanksgiving and the people we love are with us still, serving our sentences with us. Counting the days with us. Their love is our parole. Let’s bow our heads and say thanks for them, thanks for our good luck. Because we are loved, prison doesn’t have to be where freedom ends . . . it might be[…]”

            aren’t saying?”
         
         
         Allie was going to reply, opened her mouth, closed it, then opened it again and said, “How did you have the courage to—be
            a woman?”
         
         
         Whatever Robin was expecting, it wasn’t that. She drew her head back slightly and then laughed. “I wonder the exact same thing about every woman I meet. Every day.” Her smile faded slightly. “What are you doing? Can you please try to explain?”
