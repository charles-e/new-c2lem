To quote from the book, “my mind is overshadowed by a cloud of disappointment.” The only developed character who inspires sympathy is the monster. This book is pulpy crap which contains the germ of the idea about a mad scientist who creates a sentient creature. But Shelley was first and got the golden ticket: immortality by way of the literary canon. I feel that this book was worth reading because it gives you this perspective on the canon, that is, that a book can be *important* while at the same time not even remotely pleasant to read and of no value as an example to emulate. I feel a little unfair criticizing the very young author Mary Shelley but luckily she isn’t around to defend herself.
