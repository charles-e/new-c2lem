I listened to this because amazon seems to think its worth publishing for real.  It is an almost "lovecraftian" book in that it is existential horror brought about not by "elder gods" but by some other human-antithetical species(?).  It does have a creepy tone but at the same time it was just kinda slow.  Luckily 9ish hours just flies by in the car.
