### Science
* [Memories outside the Brain](https://neurosciencenews.com/organ-cell-memory-genetics-28004/)
* [Viral Cancer Treatment](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03647-0)
### AI Stuff
* [Trip Planner](https://mytrip.city/)
* [iMessage Secretary](https://www.secretary.my/customize) – started playing with this. For example I asked to to give me updates on three updates daily on SOLUSD (my only little crypto bag) which worked whereas it did not know what to do to track “Solana”. I am also letting it track my reading – to what end I am not sure.
### Nerd
* A [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ln-8QM8KhQ) breaking down the tech stack and implementation of a really fast catalog site. I used to stay on top of this stuff so it was a nice review for *me*.
### Hippie BS
* [Secret of Here](https://iainsthomas.com/2019/05/22/the-secret-of-here/)
### Who Knew?
* [Kansas City Ford Cave](https://www.hagerty.com/media/automotive-history/since-the-60s-ford-has-stored-cars-underground-in-a-kansas-city-cave/)
* [Ice Plant is Edible](https://youtu.be/fDMsUPj4svE?si=TEEcw_6Bc3tlombs)
### Pretty Colors
* [Nile Green]()
* [Mayan Blue](https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20180816-the-rare-blue-the-mayans-invented)
* [Mauve](https://sesquiotic.com/2024/07/11/mauve/) (This is from Sesquitica a vocabulary blog that I return to frequently.)
### Ran-do
* [Your guide to Egyptian Gods](https://www.britishmuseum.org/learn/schools/ages-7-11/ancient-egypt/ancient-egyptian-gods-and-goddesses) (thank you British Museum)
* [R Speen](https://rspeen.com/) is a nice looking vanity blog (for a possibly fictional person) that actually seems to be regularly updated. I got here looking for a Steely Dan lyric explanation (can’t remember now) and this site has SD reviews/commentary as one (of several) loci of interest. This is the sort of blog that sounds great in theory to start but quickly (IMHO) becomes a PITA to maintain relative to the rewards; hence I am tantalized by the cussedness of whoever is behind this.
### Investing
* [Men Faber Interview](https://www.barrons.com/articles/dividends-value-investing-strategy-meb-faber-5dbdda0f?st=TMshZH&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink)
### Politics (Kinda)
* [Enshittfication and Stuff](https://pluralistic.net/2024/11/07/usurpers-helpmeets/#disreintermediation) (I read Cory Doctorow regularly. Doctorow seems, at first glance, like a Tech Lib-Hippie with a Beard but is surprisingly sane, realistic and clean shaven to the best of my experience.)
