### AI
* [AI in a Browser](https://openai.com/index/introducing-operator/)
* A specific DNA language model has [discovered (probably) 70,000 new RNA viruses](https://singularityhub.com/2024/10/23/scientists-just-discovered-over-70000-bizarre-new-viruses-with-ai/)
from existing samples (returning false positives only 0.014 percent of the time).
* And now here is [Deep Seek](https://www.deepseek.com/).

### Pretty Colors
* [Psychedelic Edition](https://benpence.com/blog/post/psychedelic-graphics-0) ...err graphics programming

### Space
* [Oxygen on the Moon](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd7nr8wv5r9o) is something we will def need in
order to build a lunar colony.

### Cool
* The definition of cool is [building a castle from scratch](https://www.guedelon.fr/en/).

### Modern Life
* I really won't have to worry about
*my* [digital afterlife](https://singularityhub.com/2025/01/21/logging-off-life-but-living-on-how-ai-is-redefining-death-memory-and-immortality/)
but for a significant number of people that is now a *concern*.

### Home Economics
* This week I added a [fire stick](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Fire-TV-Stick-4K-with-USB-Power-Cable/dp/B0D6HLRD9H) to my 65" TCL (mounted to the wall in the living room) that has horrible Google innards.
Horrible means: that it forgot how to stay on WIFI at least once a day (requiring me to unplug/plug it) and that button-push response time was just barely ok.
Now and my life is noticably nicer: WIFI just works and buttons do things without delay).  No need to buy a new TV!!!
I am pretty sure a [Roku stick](https://www.amazon.com/Roku-Streaming-Device-Vision-Controls/dp/B09BKCDXZC?sr=1-3) would be just as much of an improvement but there I was on Amazon...
