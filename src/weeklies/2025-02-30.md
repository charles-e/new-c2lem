### Algorithms
* This here site attempts to explain [Markov Chains](https://setosa.io/ev/markov-chains/) visually and at first glance its just super clean and educational.

### MacOS
* [Tips & Tricks](https://saurabhs.org/macos-tips) -- definitely worth the price of admission! (At least for me, but I am not a hardcore user like I was back in the day.)

this weird cult.

### Emotions
* ... and [how to manage them](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250226-the-expert-guide-to-taking-control-of-your-emotions).  It has suggestions for tactics that were new to me (and hence seem clever).
