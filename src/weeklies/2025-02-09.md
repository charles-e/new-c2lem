### Crypto
* [Grifters Gonna Grift](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2025-trump-token-memecoin-crypto-finance/?embedded-checkout=true) is the
easy title, but this is really just a typical memecoin-pump-and-dump.

### Useful
* I am definitely late to the party for [the Marginalia Search Engine](https://marginalia-search.com/), but it looks
intriguingly noncommercial and non-AI-oriented.

### Sci-fi
* Here is [an ongoing class on _the_ Octavia Butler.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2Thi573CgI)

### Black Studies
* I found the Octavia Butler class from the [HillmanTok Curriculum page.](https://www.tiktok.com/@livewithmichaele/video/7463300948853607723)

### Language
* I am sure somebody needs this [game](https://cantoscrolls.com/) for learning Cantonese.

### AI
* A bunch of [scrolls from ancient Pompeii decyphered using AI.](https://www.thefp.com/p/luke-farritor-vesuvius-challenge-scrolls-rome)

### Wildlife
* TL/DR: [there are 20 quadrillion ants on earth](https://www.science.org/content/article/how-many-ants-live-earth)(Actually
its a pretty short article)
* The Mount Lyell shrew [has been photographed.](https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/elusive-california-mammal-photographed-20040772.php)

### Pretty Colors
* [Palettes](https://lospec.com/palette-list) from various pieces of pixel art.

### Internet
* [The Ladybird Browser](https://ladybird.org/) built from scratch and independent of both Chrome and Firefox.

### Music
* Do you like [jazz](https://aviary.library.vanderbilt.edu/collections/2137)?

### Food
* [What even, is a perfectly cooked egg?](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44172-024-00334-w).  The article, in figure 4,
has a nice graphical explanation and, indeed, it seems like a very nice egg with a jellied, soft yolk and a cooked white,
however, achieving this requires 30 minutes and way too many steps; at least compared to breaking the egg into a glass,
adding a half cup of water then nuking for 30 seconds.

### Cool
* [An analog tank-simulator.](https://youtu.be/AcQifPHcMLE)

### Things I want
* [A utility bike with two chains and two gears.](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/02/why-it-makes-perfect-sense-for-this-bike-to-have-two-gears-and-two-chains/)

### Archeaology
* [A newly discovered pyramid in Peru.](https://omniletters.com/hidden-pyramid-structure-discovered-near-caral/)
