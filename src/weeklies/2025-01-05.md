(sorry for the lateness, family stuff... needs must ... etc)
### Animals
* [Comb Jellies fuse into a single organism.](https://boingboing.net/2024/12/30/these-bizarre-animals-can-fuse-together-becoming-a-single-life-form.html)
* [Apparently there is no "lizard brain".](https://www.sciencefocus.com/the-human-body/the-lizard-brain-lie)
### AI
* [Unlocking Ancient Texts](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-04161-z)
* [Hacking an LLM](https://www.scworld.com/news/new-llm-jailbreak-uses-models-evaluation-skills-against-them) by using its own rules against itself.
Kinda like in that [episode of Star Trek](https://youtu.be/5uizCrcf2V0?si=MpW-yfrhjzBqOYSw) that I remember vaguely.

### Investing
* [AI Trading Arena](https://trading.snagra.com/) is where AI bots compete at stock trading.
I suppose I could have filed this under "AI" but greed wins in this case.  This is a little sketch
because the site has no supporting documents explaining, for example, how the three bots are
prompted. But on the other hand each bet has an
expiration date. This morning (1/6/2025) I see that one of the AI bots sold something after only a day.
Definitely a little sketch.

### Random
* People apparently spend a great deal of mental energy on Sudoku and this [article](https://desystemize.substack.com/p/desystemize-9)
shows how much I did not know about these puzzles.
