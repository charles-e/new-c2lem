### Sci-fi
* Believe it or not, I had not heard of [Dyson Trees](https://boingboing.net/2025/01/16/dyson-trees-could-make-a-home-for-humans-and-other-things.html) before
* Nor have I heard of [Barry Malzberg](https://boingboing.net/2025/01/02/dark-sci-fi-genius-wrote-at-superhuman-speed-barry-malzberg.html)

### Gadgets
* [This paper-like tablet](https://daylightcomputer.com/product) looks like something I almost need.
* I need a [gadget like this](https://boingboing.net/2025/01/16/find-the-perfect-color-match-every-time-with-this-handy-dandy-sensor.html) to match
all the pretty colors.

### Creativity
* Charles Darwin's kids [put drawings](https://www.openculture.com/2025/01/discover-the-playful-drawings-that-charles-darwins-children-left-on-his-manuscripts.html) on
his manuscripts that are pretty adorable.

### Education
* [Sooooo many free classes](https://www.openculture.com/freeonlinecourses) and I found one on Jack Kerouac.

### Random
* [An Encyclopedia of Unknowns](https://wikenigma.org.uk/content/language/etymology/huguenot_etymology) is just what I needed to fill my day.

### Nerdery
* A game developed by a computer (even the name is computer generated): [Yavalath](https://cambolbro.com/games/yavalath/)!
