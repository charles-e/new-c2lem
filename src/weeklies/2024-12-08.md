### AI (yet again)

-   The Browser Company the dudes who build [Arc](https://arc.net/) (my current browser) are [recruiting devs](https://youtu.be/C25g53PC5QQ?si=QCiNBkuH1Ahp4vPH) to build a new web browser based on ….. you guessed it.
-   Why did I not link to an [article about vocabulary](https://www.theverge.com/24201441/ai-terminology-explained-humans) before now? (really this is helpful)
-   Waymo autonomous taxi service [is expanding to LA](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/12/waymo-opens-robotaxi-service-to-anyone-in-los-angeles.html). This is a real reason to eventually break up the Alphabet Behemoth. (or cynically invest in it)
-   [What Vernor Vinge thought about AI in 1993!!!](https://edoras.sdsu.edu/~vinge/misc/singularity.html)
-   [State of AI 2024](https://www.stateof.ai/) which I found in [this article](https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/5/24313373/ai-spending-enterprise-profits-investment-menlo-ventures-openai-anthropic-decoder-podcast).

### Scepticism

-   [A City on Mars](https://www.amazon.com/City-Mars-settle-thought-through-ebook/dp/B0BWH5YYTR?dib_tag=se&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.Z28-UphjPmgZJYiPZY8XlldkfnBA6L8mPVa2znR4PrqvJTm-huyv5DI1CI_W0qnFenDCN96s8GM3lRDhdEXw0gkqtaYj68rXTq4MejJPYd4R8yfy0578L3eTpPD0-2NlaRm_VLoxoe8oorV2zS71wKj0fmzo1GYS9RnsKcRThKIrXlH1owoAQEztZzcCju6yg4YrJn0P8_lKpSIv5gRkw1JsMoyfsJv2EeZEQuYOlE4.ZWSH6bULbz56CZh1v9DUcK-CkCEn3axI76GW5D_vvno&qid=1733465050&sr=8-1) is a book that I somehow missed last year.

### Miracles and Wonders

-   The painstakingly proven existence of [fish brain microbiomes](https://www.quantamagazine.org/fish-have-a-brain-microbiome-could-humans-have-one-too-20241202/) (say that three times fast) implies the possibility of mammal/human brain microbiomes.
-   [MIT’s ion powered plane](https://news.mit.edu/2018/first-ionic-wind-plane-no-moving-parts-1121)

### Rat Holes

-   I had never heard of kidney suet until I saw this [chili recipe](http://textfiles.com/food/margos.txt) and then this [one](http://textfiles.com/food/oldtime.txt). And I found both of these recipes at [textfiles.com](http://textfiles.com/), which appears to be a platonically perfect internet rathole.
-   Need a 3d printable for a [fainted Charmander](https://pkrsstudio.gumroad.com/l/fntdcharmander?layout=discover&recommended_by=search&_gl=1*vw034*_ga*OTgxNDM2MTA5LjE3MzM1OTk1OTg.*_ga_6LJN6D94N6*MTczMzYyODg0Ny4yLjEuMTczMzYyOTk4NS4wLjAuMA..)? [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/) has you covered.

### Sad

-   Because of course [AI-pimping](https://www.marketplace.org/shows/marketplace-tech/ai-pimping-accounts-are-exploding-on-social-media/) is a thing – it will be the word of the year in 2025 – you read it here first.

### Happy

-   [Christmas Decor for mac users.](https://boingboing.net/2024/12/07/decorate-your-mac-for-the-holidays-with-festivitas.html)

### Organizing

-   I use Apple Notes …. to keep notes (because you-know, mac + iphone.) Anyway, a guy has made a [disciplined system to organize said notes](https://youtu.be/Oe1453Ugylc?si=vL1EVhmegcKDdLEo) and, because this is a universe that follows patterns, he sounds German.

### Zeitgeist

-   is currently, apparently [kinda bloodthirsty](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/unitedhealthcare-ceo-shooting-suspect-photos-internet-reaction-1235194379/)

### Baking/TV

-   Fergalukecious says that they are shaking up the cast of the Great British Baking Show. Its on Tiktok so it must be true. Of course they are keeping Paul Hollywood; his handshake is the real prize.
