### AI
* Physics-based entropy generators are very important in certain AI problems [and Extropic.ai is developing these things.](https://www.extropic.ai/future).  If you believe the hype, it means orders of magnitude improvements in AI scalability.  Of course this technology is above my paygrade.

### Applied Math
* MIT has the developed the math [to predict when crowds become disordered.](https://news.mit.edu/2025/mathematicians-uncover-logic-behind-how-crowds-walk-0324)

### Sanity
* Are suffering from news opinion fatigue?  An (at least partial) solution is using an RSS reader.  On my mac I am have [reeder ($10 a year)](https://reederapp.com/) which I have configured to get (amongest other things) news feeds.  The articles are served without adds and without commentary threads which is itself is a relief.  I have feeds from [WSJ World News](https://feeds.content.dowjones.io/public/rss/RSSWorldNews), [WSJ U.S. News](https://feeds.content.dowjones.io/public/rss/RSSUSnews) and [News Nation Now](https://newsnationnow.com/feed)

### History
* A fun [blog about renaissance history](https://www.exurbe.com/) meant to hype up a book.

### Biology
* Have scientists discovered [a new branch on the tree of life?](https://www.livescience.com/animals/giant-fungus-like-organism-may-be-a-completely-unknown-branch-of-life)
* [Hollywood and Monsters](https://fathom.lib.uchicago.edu/2/21701757/)

### Music
* [Fake Books and Real Books](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/the-real-book)

### Pretty Colors
* [Pink](https://www.wsj.com/arts-culture/books/pink-review-a-color-pretty-powerful-and-perplexing-d4e0eef6)
