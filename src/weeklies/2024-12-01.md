### Food

-   I have enjoyed various breakfast foods from China, [congee for example](https://www.historians.org/perspectives-article/bridging-cultures-nourishing-souls-the-melting-pot-symphony-of-chinese-american-congee-march-2024/), and now I am tempted to try making it for myself.
-   [Roberto’s Tacos](https://youtu.be/mjDMizzbWGA?si=UJgWzfxS8CuqPN3v) (ancestor, allegedly, probably, to all other “ertos”) has an origin story.

### Social Media

-   [Bluesky has bugs just like any other piece of new software](https://github.com/bluesky-social/social-app/issues/6493). Only interesting to me b/c its a bug with the DNS account verification feature I only discovered (and started using) last week.
-   [I guess it’s possible, to host a website on Bluesky.](https://danielmangum.com/posts/this-website-is-hosted-on-bluesky/)
-   More [in depth](https://www.techpolicy.press/where-does-power-consolidate-on-bluesky/) about how blusky.app moderates free speech (eer who has the power to censor, label, block or mute.). They seem successful so far, but how is this going to be attacked?

### Pretty Colors

-   [Pyrrole, aka Ferrari Red](https://www.jacksonsart.com/blog/2024/09/03/the-accidental-invention-of-pyrrole-red/#:~:text=Pyrrole%20Red%20is%20a%20modern,turn%20of%20the%2020th%20century.)
-   All these videos with pretty [color palettes](https://www.youtube.com/@colorpalette_painting).

### Harkening back

-   R Speen seems to be the home of a certain [Randy Russell podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-randy-russell-podcast/id1447983931) that seems to be about artists, creators who hail from the upper midwest. His [restaurant reviews](https://rspeen.com/diner) are certainly Milwaukee-centric. Why does this make me so happy?
-   [This](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5.pdf) CIA memo is a nice follow up to the [Whoa Trippy post from last week](https://links.c2lem.com/2024/11/24/november-24-2024/#woooh).

### AI

-   This [article about LIDAR](https://www.viksnewsletter.com/p/short-intro-to-automotive-lidar) is AI-adjacent.
-   Is [this](https://labs.google/genchess) creative? Do I need to walk back my statement from last week (already!!!!)?
-   (courtesy of tiktok/[nate.b.jones](https://linktr.ee/natebjones)). Supposed to be building an OS for AI agents, but If nothing else, they have a [cute landing page](https://sdsa.ai/).
-   Do you want/need to take an AI (machine learning) class? I can definitely recommend [this one](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction). I took it in 2012(?). Back then we weren’t using python and there was no TensorFlow (cos it didn’t exist).

### UI

-   [Just Like Paper.](https://www.lukasmoro.com/paper) Screens and keyboards can not replace paper and pencil because there is something primal in the way writing connects with our brains IMHO.
-   Another super interesting [user interface](https://dynamicland.org/2024/Intro/). (an immense understatement)
