### Math
* [The Neurology of Zero](https://aeon.co/essays/why-zero-could-unlock-how-the-brain-perceives-absence) vs the neurology of nothing.
* [A book on History of Maths](https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2025/03/13/history-of-maths-for-beginners/)

### AI
* It seems everybody thinks that AI can [break *really* difficult codes](https://boingboing.net/2025/03/08/cia-kryptos-sculptor-disgusted-by-flood-of-wrong-ai-solutions.html) when really, no.

### Miracles and Wonders
* Is this [E-Taste or Smell-o-vision](https://singularityhub.com/2025/03/03/you-can-taste-cake-in-virtual-reality-with-this-new-device/)?
* [Memory Transplants](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-44111476). Thank you Adrian Tchaikovsky for the pointer.

### Discovery
* [Thousands of previously unknown species in the Mariana Trench.](https://singularityhub.com/2025/03/06/scientists-discover-thousands-of-new-microbial-species-thriving-in-the-mariana-trench/)

### COVID
* [This](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.adq5720) means (I think) better vaccines. Thank you Nick Harkaway for the pointer.

### Language

* [This](https://pudding.cool/2025/03/language/?user_id=67cf1d1265d32d552f07c89f) is an analysis of animal sounds (onomatapoiea) across many languages.

### Extreme
* An article that mostly clearly explains the non-intuitive [dangers of plutonium exposure](https://worksinprogress.co/issue/the-most-dangerous-substance-known-to-man/) and concludes that "our fear of plutonium is overblown".  The article is quite unsettling to me.

### Paranoia
* A [font](https://fleg.de/paranoia) about fear of surveillance and censorship.  True story: in the late 80's, when the internet was tiny, one of my aging hippie co-workers had email .signature file that routinely added a list of marijuana-LSD-drug-related keywords on the assumption that the CIA/FBI was reading email.
