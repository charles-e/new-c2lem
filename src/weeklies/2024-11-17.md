### Internet Greybeard Stuff

-   [Gopher coulda been the Web](https://www.abortretry.fail/p/the-internet-gopher-from-minnesota)

### Science (eeerrr Math)

-   [Largest Prime Number discovered.](https://phys.org/news/2024-11-million-digit-prime-biggest-mathematicians.html) (For now of course.)

### Politics: Make of it what you will

-   I already voted with my feet by leaving California but this article has ideas for [better liberal economic policies](https://zachariahschwab.com/essays/sewer-liberalism).

### AI Stuff

-   [AI Grandma to Frustrate Phone Scammers](https://gizmodo.com/telecom-builds-ai-grandmother-bot-to-talk-to-phone-scammers-and-waste-their-time-2000524579)

### Las Vegas, Nerd

-   The city of LV may be a libertarian, gambling fueled, hell hole but the government does some cool stuff occasionally. For example: classes in [3D Printing](https://innovate.vegas/3d-Maker-Center) along with publicly available 3D Printers (at least one I am told.) They, 3D printers that is, are also available to access in our public libraries.

### Makes Me Smile

-   [The Forest Jar](https://youtu.be/DfYlimHqzPU?si=kvjD7glH3_VSlNUG) came to me by way of TikTok and now I follow it on Patreon. More people need to see this stuff.

### Social Media

-   [Bluesky is open](https://bsky.app/) and I assume I am late to this party. Anyway, over there on that thing, as of 23 hours ago, I am @c2lem.bsky.social. So far it feels remarkably not annoying or, in other words, its a giant libtard echo chamber and I am right at home.
-   Also some things that [Bluesky can do](https://www.theverge.com/24295933/bluesky-social-network-custom-how-to) that I have not tried yet.
