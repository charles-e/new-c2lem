As I kid I ate these rolls with great zeal; my aunt made these for us at Thanksgiving and Christmas and the recipe came
straight out of the old-school three-ring binder Betty Crocker cookbook.  
This makes a sweet roll but the consistency is dense compared to store-bought.  
Also these reheat well, which is good because they are much better hot.

## Ingredients

* 2 packages active dry yeast (4.5 Tsp)
* 1 cup warm water (105 to 115)  OR / 1 cup milk.
* ½ cup sugar
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 2 eggs
* ½ cup shortening (cubed soft butter) 
* 4 cups all-purpose flour
* Soft butter or margarine (to brush before baking)

## Directions
- Dissolve yeast in warm milk. Stir in sugar, salt, eggs, shortening and 2 cups of the flour. Beat until smooth. Mix in remaining flour until smooth.
- Scrape dough from side of bowl. Cover; let rise in warm place until double, about 1½ hours.
- Divide dough in half; roll each half into 12-inch circle. Spread with butter; cut into 16 wedges.
- Roll up each wedge, beginning at rounded edge.
- Place rolls, with point under, on greased baking sheet. Cover; let rise until double, about 1 hour.
- Heat oven to 375°. Bake 12 to 15 minutes or until golden brown. Brush rolls with butter.
Makes 32 rolls.
Tips: 
- Softening and cutting the butter is important.  You want the mix process to be as fast as possible for softer rolls.
- Longer rise is better
- When rolling pull out the bottom corners of the triangle and keep stretching out the dough as you roll up. This will help the crescent shape.
- And/or vertically slit the center bottom of the dough triangle maybe 1/2 an inch.  This will allegedly help the crescent shape.
