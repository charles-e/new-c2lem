## Notes:
A cup is the total combined amount of chocolate and/or nuts (nut allergies are a thing! I am told) for platonically ideal cookies. Imagine my shock and existential horror should you choose otherwise.  (Actually when I first made them I used a cup and a half but apparently my tastes have changed.)

## Directions 
Preheat oven to 350F.
### Combine:
* 1 stick melted butter (cooled but still mostly liquid) 
* 1/2 cup sugar
* 3/4 cup light brown sugar
* 1 egg
* 1 t vanilla

### Add:
* 1 1/4 C flour
* 1/2 t baking soda
* 1 t salt (I use less) only if using unsalted butter
### Add:
* 1/2 C chocolate chips
* 1/2 C rough chop walnuts (or nuts of choice)

If the dough is not holding together well at this point you can add a teaspoon at a time of water until it is a (just) smooth, scoop-able dough.
Recipe says refrigerate 1 hour but I don’t bother with that.
I use 3 Tbsp scoop. 6-8 per Silpat. Bake 17 minutes for crisp or less for chewy. (Tested 2/3/23 by Charles) Makes 10 cookies.

Easy peasy - you don’t absolutely need a stand mixer for this. (I nuke the butter for 60 seconds in a 2 quart glass/ceramic bowl and then mix the rest of the ingredients in that same bowl.)
I do double or triple recipes - but then you will need a stand mixer.
