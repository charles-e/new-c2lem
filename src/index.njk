<h1>Welcome to c2lem.com</h1>

<h2>Who?</h2>
My domain name explained:
<ul>
    <li> "c" == Charles</li>
    <li> "2" == to</li>
    <li>"lem" == "le magne" (french) == (in english) "the great"</li>
</ul>
<p>So, Charlemagne, just Charles really, and, no, I am neither French nor Norman nor Great. 
    This is the internet; I could be a dog for all you know.
    Be that as it may, you are visiting  my small internet domain/empire; my <i>pied-a-terre</i> if you will.
    </p>
<h2>What?</h2>
<p>Whatever I am interested in that's worth posting and for now this includes:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="/books/">Books</a>: For newer books these posts are (no spoilers) reviews. Otherwise, these are just observations for my own memory.
    <li><a href="/books/in-progress/">Now Reading</a>: is pretty self explanatory.</li>
    <li><a href="/weeklies/">Blog</a>: with weekly posts. And a post is just a bunch of links that I find topical, distracting or otherwise interesting.  YMMV.</li>

</ul>
    </p>
<h2>How?</h2>
<p>I have been maintaining a blog on <a href="https://wordpress.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WordPress.com</a> but I found that as a beginner, it really
    wants me to "pick a lane" for my content (so either book stuff or news stuff but no easy
    way to have them both in the same blog without too much effort.) And on top of that, you pay 
    for the service. So I have been puttering around with a thing called <a href="https://weborigami.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Web Origami</a> and I was 
    hoping to eventually produce something I could host for cheaper than WordPress.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Then one day a few months ago, I found <a href="https://pages.cloudflare.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cloudflare Pages</a> and its free tier will let me host the blog.
    </li>
    <li>
        Last week then I decided I would let an AI (specifically <a href="https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gemini</a>) help me design my blog to re-use
        the markdown posts that were already in WordPress. "What's the worst that could happen?", I thought.
    </li>
    <li>
        The AI suggested I use a blog generator package called <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eleventy</a>, and then like a newbie I asked it
        to generate the whole blog with book notes and weekly posts... After a few hours I eventually got 
        stuck where it couldn't seem to make everything work. I was stuck.
    </li>
    <li>
    So I started over again with the intention of taking baby steps. To make a "clean start", 
    this time I used <a href="https://openai.com/chatgpt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ChatGPT</a>, and it also wanted to use Eleventy.  
        I asked it to just create a book blog. 
        Once I got that working I moved on to books in progress to go along side the book review posts; once that was
        working I moved on to RSS feeds and so on... It has taken about a day working with the AI (and me
        doing a whole bunch of copying/pasting and diagnosing of bugs) and I have something that doesn't embarrass me.
