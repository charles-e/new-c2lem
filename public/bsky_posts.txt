🦇📚 Book Review 📚🦇
The Buffalo Hunter Hunter by Stephen Graham Jones
🩸🧛‍♂️🌄🪶 
A unique vampire story set in 1912 Montana, exploring colonial brutality and personal vengeance, the ending was fun and rescues a slow middle plot.

📚✨ Book Review ✨📚
The Magician of Tiger Castle by Louis Sachar
❌⚠️📉
A deeply flawed book that sabotages its own plot, resulting in a disappointing and unsatisfying reading experience. You can spend your time reading far better books or hit me back and tell me I am wrong.
